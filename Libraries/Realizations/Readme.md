<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This directory defines the official realization families for the intrinsic standardized widget classes of FROG.
</p>

<p>
A realization family specifies how already-published widget classes may be embodied visually and interactively while remaining subordinate to class law, bounded behavior law, and the source-level widget model.
</p>

<p>
A realization family is not the owner of widget semantics.
It is the official publication surface for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>state-sensitive visual embodiment,</li>
  <li>part-to-realization correspondence,</li>
  <li>placement posture for dynamically rendered public parts,</li>
  <li>recommended resource organization,</li>
  <li>host-facing realization expectations.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="why-this-directory-exists">2. Why this Directory Exists</h2>

<p>
Once standard widget classes exist, the next architectural need is to define how an official realization family may embody them without collapsing semantics into skins, SVG files, or one runtime-private toolkit mapping.
</p>

<p>
Without a realization layer:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the standard widget baseline remains too abstract for serious front-panel publication,</li>
  <li>each runtime is tempted to invent its own de facto visual standard,</li>
  <li>SVG and host assets drift toward semantic ownership,</li>
  <li>state-specific skins become ad hoc rather than structured,</li>
  <li>dynamic text-bearing parts risk being treated as asset-only content instead of realization-bound surfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This directory exists to prevent that drift.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="scope">3. Scope</h2>

<p>
This directory defines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>official realization families for standard widgets,</li>
  <li>their realization-side state posture,</li>
  <li>their part-to-realization posture,</li>
  <li>their resource-organization posture,</li>
  <li>their host-facing realization expectations,</li>
  <li>their fallback posture when resources or host features are unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This directory does not define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>widget class identity,</li>
  <li>widget properties, methods, events, or parts as public law,</li>
  <li>the generic realization doctrine of the language,</li>
  <li>the generic <code>.wfrog</code> package format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory toolkit-specific implementation.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="architectural-position">4. Architectural Position</h2>

<p>
The standard realization layer occupies the following position:
</p>

<pre><code>Libraries/Widgets/      -&gt; intrinsic standardized class law baseline
Libraries/Realizations/ -&gt; official realization families for those classes
Expression/             -&gt; source model and generic realization boundary
.wfrog publication      -&gt; machine-readable publication of realization artifacts
Implementations/        -&gt; runtime and host execution of realization families
</code></pre>

<p>
This means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>class identity is upstream from realization,</li>
  <li>realization is upstream from machine-readable realization publication,</li>
  <li>machine-readable realization publication is upstream from host-private rendering details,</li>
  <li>runtime-private implementation remains downstream from published realization posture.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="ownership-boundary">5. Ownership Boundary</h2>

<p>
The following ownership boundary is normative:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>Libraries/Widgets/</code></strong> owns which standard classes exist and what their public surfaces mean.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Libraries/Realizations/</code></strong> owns official realization-family posture for those classes.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Expression/Widget realization.md</code></strong> owns the generic realization doctrine.</li>
  <li><strong><code>Expression/Widget package (.wfrog).md</code></strong> owns the widget-oriented publication format.</li>
  <li><strong>SVG and other visual assets</strong> remain realization resources, not semantic truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a realization family MUST NOT invent public widget semantics,</li>
  <li>a realization family MUST NOT redefine class identity,</li>
  <li>a realization family MAY define visual states, state-to-resource mappings, part bindings, anchors, and placement surfaces,</li>
  <li>a runtime MAY realize the same family differently internally while preserving its published posture.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-a-standard-realization-family-is">6. What a Standard Realization Family Is</h2>

<p>
A standard realization family is an official published realization posture associated with one or more standard widget classes.
</p>

<p>
A realization family SHOULD define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>family identity,</li>
  <li>target widget classes,</li>
  <li>state inventory,</li>
  <li>part-to-realization mapping posture,</li>
  <li>resource naming posture,</li>
  <li>host-facing realization expectations,</li>
  <li>fallback posture when a resource or host feature is unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A realization family MAY also define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>structural bindings between public parts and realization-side surfaces,</li>
  <li>anchor or text-region publication for host-rendered dynamic parts,</li>
  <li>state-sensitive resource families for specific parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A realization family is allowed to have multiple state-specific assets for the same widget or widget part.
That does not make the asset the source of semantic truth.
It only makes the realization explicit and inspectable.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="current-standard-family">7. Current Standard Family</h2>

<p>
The first official realization family published here is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Default/</code> — the default standard realization family for the intrinsic widget baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This family exists to provide:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a first coherent official embodiment of the standard widget baseline,</li>
  <li>a stable reference target for examples,</li>
  <li>a concrete realization posture that runtimes may interpret faithfully or approximate compatibly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>Default</code> family also serves as the first end-to-end example of how realization-side states, structural part bindings, and dynamic placement surfaces can be published without redefining widget semantics.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relationship-with-widgets">8. Relationship with Standard Widget Classes</h2>

<p>
Every realization family document in this directory is downstream from one or more standard widget class documents in <code>Libraries/Widgets/</code>.
</p>

<p>
This means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the widget class defines which public parts and public surfaces exist,</li>
  <li>the realization family defines how those parts and surfaces are embodied visually,</li>
  <li>the runtime interprets the resulting realization posture without becoming its semantic owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The realization family may publish how a label is placed, clipped, styled by default, or mapped to a visual surface.
It does not become the semantic owner of the label text or of other dynamic widget data.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relationship-with-wfrog-and-assets">9. Relationship with <code>.wfrog</code> and Assets</h2>

<p>
This directory defines the normative documentation posture of realization families.
</p>

<p>
Machine-readable publication may later be carried through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>.wfrog</code> realization libraries,</li>
  <li>resource manifests,</li>
  <li>SVG and other visual assets,</li>
  <li>part-binding maps,</li>
  <li>state maps,</li>
  <li>anchor maps or text-region maps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The governing rule remains:
</p>

<pre><code>published class law
    !=
published realization family
    !=
machine-readable realization package
    !=
visual asset
    !=
runtime-private rendering implementation
</code></pre>

<p>
This separation is especially important for dynamic text-bearing parts.
A visual asset may provide decoration, background, or anchor geometry,
but it must not become the only semantic owner of live user-facing text.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="state-binding-and-placement-posture">10. State, Binding, and Placement Posture</h2>

<p>
A realization family MAY define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>widget-level states such as <code>normal</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>focused</code>, or <code>pressed</code>,</li>
  <li>part-level states such as <code>increment_button.pressed</code>,</li>
  <li>resource maps that assign state-sensitive assets to widget parts,</li>
  <li>structural bindings that associate public parts with realization surfaces,</li>
  <li>anchors, text regions, or equivalent placement surfaces for dynamically rendered public parts,</li>
  <li>fallback rules when a specialized resource or placement surface is unavailable.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This directory is therefore the correct place for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>multiple SVG skins or state-specific SVG fragments,</li>
  <li>part-level visual mappings,</li>
  <li>anchor publication for dynamic labels,</li>
  <li>inspectable fallback posture.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is not the correct place to redefine widget law.
</p>

<p>
A useful rule of thumb is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>state maps</strong> answer which resource embodies a part in a given realization state,</li>
  <li><strong>part bindings</strong> answer where a public part lives in the realization structure,</li>
  <li><strong>anchors or text regions</strong> answer where a host should place dynamically rendered content.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="portability">11. Portability</h2>

<p>
A standard realization family is portable if:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>its target class law remains preserved,</li>
  <li>its public parts remain recognizable,</li>
  <li>its published realization-state posture remains preserved,</li>
  <li>its structural bindings remain interpretable,</li>
  <li>its host-specific substitutions do not change the public interaction meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Pixel-identical rendering is not required.
Semantic and realization-structure compatibility is required.
</p>

<p>
This portability requirement is what allows one official realization family to be interpreted across Python, Rust, and C/C++ runtime families without turning one implementation into the real definition of the UI system.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="status">12. Status</h2>

<p>
This directory defines the official realization-family layer for the intrinsic standard widget baseline.
</p>

<p>
Its closure direction is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>explicit official realization families,</li>
  <li>clean separation between class law and realization resources,</li>
  <li>state-structured and binding-structured publication,</li>
  <li>inspectable dynamic-placement posture for dynamic public parts,</li>
  <li>multi-runtime realizability without semantic drift.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="summary">13. Summary</h2>

<p>
This directory defines how official realization families may embody the intrinsic standard widget classes of FROG.
</p>

<p>
In short:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Libraries/Widgets/</code> defines what the widget is,</li>
  <li><code>Libraries/Realizations/</code> defines how an official standard family embodies it,</li>
  <li><code>.wfrog</code> packages and assets may later materialize that family machine-readably,</li>
  <li>runtimes interpret the family without becoming the owner of its meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The central architectural rule is simple:
realization may define embodiment, mapping, placement, and fallback,
but semantic widget meaning remains upstream from realization and cannot be delegated to assets or to one runtime implementation.
</p>
