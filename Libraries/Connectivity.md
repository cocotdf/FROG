<h2 id="status">1. Status</h2>

<p>
This file is a <strong>transition stub</strong>.
</p>

<p>
It exists only to preserve continuity for readers, links, and repository navigation
for the <code>frog.connectivity.*</code> namespace.
</p>

<p>
It is <strong>not</strong> the authoritative normative specification.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="why-this-file-exists">2. Why this File Exists</h2>

<p>
Earlier repository organization exposed connectivity-related material under <code>Libraries/</code>.
The repository architecture has since been clarified.
</p>

<p>
The intrinsic library layer and the optional profile layer are now separated more explicitly:
</p>

<pre>
Libraries/  -> intrinsic standardized primitive vocabularies
Profiles/   -> optional standardized capability families
</pre>

<p>
Because older expectations, bookmarks, or inbound links may still point to
<code>Libraries/Connectivity.md</code>, this file remains as a routing note.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="normative-source">3. Normative Source</h2>

<p>
The authoritative normative specification for <code>frog.connectivity.*</code> is:
</p>

<pre><code>Profiles/Interop.md</code></pre>

<p>
That document MUST be treated as the primary normative source for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the standardized connectivity primitive surface,</li>
  <li>primitive contracts, ports, and type expectations,</li>
  <li>validation and capability boundaries,</li>
  <li>support claims related to standardized interop capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This file MUST NOT be treated as a competing normative source.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-changed">4. What Changed</h2>

<p>
What changed is the <strong>architectural ownership</strong> of the namespace.
</p>

<p>
The <code>frog.connectivity.*</code> family is no longer classified as part of the
minimal intrinsic standardized library core.
It is now classified as an <strong>optional standardized capability family</strong>
owned by the Interop profile.
</p>

<p>
This is an architectural reclassification, not a removal from the standardized FROG surface.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-did-not-change">5. What Did Not Change</h2>

<p>
The namespace identity remains stable:
</p>

<pre><code>frog.connectivity.*</code></pre>

<p>
This transition does not by itself rename the namespace or invalidate the existence
of the standardized connectivity capability family.
</p>

<p>
In short:
</p>

<pre>
Changed:
- architectural ownership
- repository classification

Unchanged:
- namespace prefix
- capability-family identity
</pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="how-to-read-this-file">6. How to Read this File</h2>

<p>
Use this file only when you need to understand <strong>why</strong> connectivity still
appears under <code>Libraries/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Do <strong>not</strong> use this file for detailed primitive definitions or normative behavior.
For those questions, read:
</p>

<pre><code>Profiles/Interop.md</code></pre>

<p>
This file SHOULD remain short.
It SHOULD NOT duplicate:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>primitive catalogs,</li>
  <li>primitive-local behavioral rules,</li>
  <li>validation rules,</li>
  <li>support-level definitions,</li>
  <li>examples already owned by the Interop profile specification.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If this transition note becomes unnecessary in a later repository phase, it MAY be
reduced further or removed.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="summary">7. Summary</h2>

<p>
<code>frog.connectivity.*</code> remains part of the standardized FROG specification surface,
but its normative home is now <strong>Profiles/Interop.md</strong>, not the intrinsic
<code>Libraries/</code> core.
</p>

<p>
This file remains only for continuity and routing.
