<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
FROG is a graphical dataflow programming language. In an acyclic graph, execution order can be derived directly from data
dependencies. However, many useful programs require feedback paths, accumulation, filtering, integration, delayed reuse of
values, or other forms of memory.
</p>

<p>
This document defines the source-facing representation of local memory in FROG and the source-level rules that govern how
cycle-valid constructs are represented in executable diagrams.
</p>

<p>
In FROG, a directed cycle is valid only when its meaning is made explicit through at least one primitive whose node
instance stores a value between activations. Such a primitive is called a local-memory primitive.
</p>

<p>
In informal terms, a local-memory primitive is a primitive with local state. The preferred normative wording in this
specification is <strong>local memory</strong>.
</p>

<p>
This document defines how explicit local memory and cyclic dataflow are represented in canonical source.
Normative execution semantics are defined by <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="goals">2. Goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — define how local memory is represented in canonical FROG source.</li>
  <li><strong>Source explicitness</strong> — require that valid feedback be represented through explicit local-memory constructs.</li>
  <li><strong>Deterministic initialization</strong> — require explicit and deterministic source-level initialization of local memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation of concerns</strong> — keep local memory distinct from global state, shared state, and runtime services.</li>
  <li><strong>Compatibility with dataflow</strong> — allow feedback while preserving an explicit and verifiable source model.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relation-with-other-specifications">3. Relation with Other Specifications</h2>

<p>
This document complements the following specifications:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Expression/Readme.md</code> — defines the role of <code>Expression/</code> as the canonical source-specification layer.</li>
  <li><code>Language/Readme.md</code> — defines the role of <code>Language/</code> as the normative execution-semantics layer.</li>
  <li><code>Expression/Diagram.md</code> — defines the executable graph structure, node kinds, edges, and graph-level source representation.</li>
  <li><code>Expression/Type.md</code> — defines type compatibility for values carried through local-memory primitives.</li>
  <li><code>Expression/Control structures.md</code> — defines structure-owned nested executable regions, which remain subject to the same cycle-facing source constraints.</li>
  <li><code>Language/State and cycles.md</code> — defines the normative execution semantics of local memory and the language-level cycle-validity rule.</li>
  <li><code>Libraries/Core.md</code> — defines standard library primitives, including <code>frog.core.delay</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document defines the canonical source-level representation of local memory and cycle-valid graph constructs.
It does not redefine the serialized graph structure already specified by <code>Expression/Diagram.md</code>, and it does not own
the normative execution semantics of local memory.

</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="local-memory">4. Local Memory</h2>

<p>
A local-memory primitive is a primitive whose node instance stores an internal value across activations of the same live
FROG instance.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, a local-memory primitive has:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a current internal state value,</li>
  <li>a rule for producing outputs from that current state and the current inputs,</li>
  <li>a rule for updating the stored state for a later activation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That local memory is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>attached to the node instance,</li>
  <li>local to that primitive instance,</li>
  <li>not a global variable,</li>
  <li>not implicitly shared with other nodes,</li>
  <li>not a general-purpose shared reference mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document defines how such local memory is represented and constrained in canonical source.
Normative observable behavior is defined by <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="stateless-vs-local-memory-primitives">5. Stateless vs Local-Memory Primitives</h2>

<h3>5.1 Stateless primitive</h3>

<p>
A stateless primitive does not preserve any value between activations.
Its outputs depend only on its current inputs and its fixed configuration.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>frog.core.add</code></li>
  <li><code>frog.core.mul</code></li>
  <li><code>frog.core.equal</code></li>
  <li><code>frog.math.sin</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Local-memory primitive</h3>

<p>
A local-memory primitive preserves an internal value between activations.
Its outputs may depend on that preserved value in addition to its current inputs.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>frog.core.delay</code></li>
  <li>future register-style primitives</li>
  <li>future integrator-style primitives</li>
  <li>future stateful signal-processing primitives</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="state-ownership-and-scope">6. State Ownership and Scope</h2>

<p>
Local memory belongs to a specific node instance inside a specific live FROG instance.
</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>two different local-memory nodes do not share state implicitly,</li>
  <li>two different sub-FROG instances do not share local memory implicitly,</li>
  <li>duplicating a node duplicates its local memory,</li>
  <li>instantiating the same sub-FROG multiple times creates distinct local memory for each instantiated graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The exact lifetime of a live FROG instance may depend on the active runtime profile.
However, within one live instance, the source model MUST remain compatible with stable and deterministic local-memory behavior.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="cycles-in-dataflow-graphs">7. Cycles in Dataflow Graphs</h2>

<p>
A directed cycle exists when a path of directed edges leads from a node back to itself.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code>A → B → C → A</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>A → A</code></pre>

<p>
In a pure dataflow graph, a cycle with no memory creates an unresolved dependency loop.
Such a graph does not define valid executable behavior by itself.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, FROG distinguishes between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>invalid combinational cycles</strong> — cycles containing no local memory,</li>
  <li><strong>valid stateful cycles</strong> — cycles containing at least one explicit local-memory primitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This distinction applies both to the top-level diagram and to region-local diagrams owned by control structures.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="cycle-validity-in-source-form">8. Cycle Validity in Source Form</h2>

<p>
The base rule of FROG v0.1 is:
</p>

<pre><code>A diagram MAY contain directed cycles.

Every directed cycle MUST contain at least one local-memory primitive.</code></pre>

<p>
Equivalent interpretation:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cycle without local memory is invalid,</li>
  <li>a cycle containing at least one local-memory primitive is valid in principle, subject to ordinary graph and type validation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This rule applies to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-node cycles,</li>
  <li>self-feedback cycles,</li>
  <li>feedback paths through nested diagram regions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A validator MAY enforce this rule using strongly connected component analysis or any equivalent graph-theoretic method.
</p>

<p>
The rule itself is normative at language level and is owned by <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
This document defines how that rule is reflected in canonical source and in source-level validation.
</p>

<p>
In source terms, a cycle is not made valid by layout, by documentation, or by informal intent.
It is only made valid when the canonical graph representation contains an explicit local-memory primitive in every directed cycle.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="frog-core-delay">9. <code>frog.core.delay</code></h2>

<p>
The minimal standard local-memory primitive for FROG v0.1 is:
</p>

<pre><code>frog.core.delay</code></pre>

<p>
Its purpose is to make delayed feedback explicit.
It stores one value and exposes that stored value on the next activation.
</p>

<h3>9.1 Ports</h3>

<p>The canonical ports of <code>frog.core.delay</code> are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>input port: <code>in</code></li>
  <li>output port: <code>out</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>9.2 Canonical node shape</h3>

<p>
A canonical source node using <code>frog.core.delay</code> MUST remain compatible with the primitive identity defined by
<code>Libraries/Core.md</code>.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "id": "delay_1",
  "kind": "primitive",
  "type": "frog.core.delay",
  "initial": 0.0
}</code></pre>

<h3>9.3 Conceptual state equation</h3>

<pre><code>out(t) = state(t)
state(t + 1) = in(t)

state(0) = initial</code></pre>

<p>
This equation is included here as the conceptual interpretation assumed by the canonical source representation.
It does not transfer ownership of normative execution semantics away from <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
</p>

<p>
This primitive is sufficient to make a feedback path explicit, deterministic, and valid in principle.
Its canonical source representation is defined here, its standardized primitive identity belongs to
<code>Libraries/Core.md</code>, and its normative observable semantics belong to <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="initial-state">10. Initial State</h2>

<p>
Every local-memory primitive MUST have a deterministic initial state.
</p>

<p>
For <code>frog.core.delay</code> in v0.1, the <code>initial</code> field is mandatory.
</p>

<p>Illustrative node shape:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "id": "delay_1",
  "kind": "primitive",
  "type": "frog.core.delay",
  "initial": 0.0
}</code></pre>

<p>Rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>initial</code> MUST be present for every <code>frog.core.delay</code> node in v0.1,</li>
  <li>the value of <code>initial</code> MUST be compatible with the value type carried by the node,</li>
  <li>the initial state MUST be fully defined by source or by a stricter profile that preserves deterministic equivalence.</li>
</ul>

<p>
FROG v0.1 does not permit undefined initial state for <code>frog.core.delay</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="source-to-semantics-mapping">11. Source-to-Semantics Mapping</h2>

<p>
Canonical source representation and normative execution semantics are intentionally separated in FROG.
This section defines how the source form declared here maps to the semantic layer owned by <code>Language/</code>.
</p>

<h3>11.1 Local-memory primitive mapping</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a node with <code>kind: "primitive"</code> and <code>type: "frog.core.delay"</code> maps to the minimal standardized local-memory primitive,</li>
  <li>its required source field <code>initial</code> maps to the primitive's deterministic initial stored value,</li>
  <li>its incoming and outgoing edges determine how explicit delayed feedback is represented in the graph.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.2 Cycle mapping</h3>

<ul>
  <li>a directed cycle identified in canonical source maps to a language-level feedback construct,</li>
  <li>the presence of at least one explicit local-memory primitive in that directed cycle maps to stateful feedback,</li>
  <li>the absence of such a primitive maps to an invalid combinational cycle.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.3 Region-local mapping</h3>

<ul>
  <li>the same source-level cycle analysis applies inside structure-owned regions,</li>
  <li>a loop structure does not by itself constitute local memory in the graph,</li>
  <li>explicit local-memory primitives remain the canonical source mechanism for representing memory in directed feedback paths.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.4 No semantic redefinition in this document</h3>

<p>
This document MUST NOT be interpreted as redefining:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>runtime scheduling strategy,</li>
  <li>the precise runtime activation model of local-memory primitives,</li>
  <li>the language-level ownership of cycle validity,</li>
  <li>the general observable semantics of delayed state across activations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those topics are owned normatively by <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="validation-rules">12. Validation Rules</h2>

<p>
Implementations MUST enforce the following source-level validation rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>every directed cycle MUST contain at least one explicit local-memory primitive,</li>
  <li>all value connections through local-memory primitives MUST remain type-compatible according to <code>Expression/Type.md</code>,</li>
  <li>local memory MUST be represented as scoped to the node instance,</li>
  <li>local memory MUST NOT be represented as implicitly shared across unrelated nodes or sub-FROG instances,</li>
  <li>the initial state of every local-memory primitive MUST be represented deterministically.</li>
</ul>

<p>For <code>frog.core.delay</code> specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the node MUST define an <code>initial</code> field,</li>
  <li><code>in</code> and <code>out</code> MUST have the same value type,</li>
  <li><code>initial</code> MUST be compatible with that type.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Tools SHOULD additionally warn when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a cycle contains more local-memory primitives than necessary and becomes difficult to understand,</li>
  <li>feedback is valid but visually unclear,</li>
  <li>multiple feedback paths make execution hard to inspect even though validation succeeds.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h3>13.1 Invalid cycle without local memory</h3>

    ]
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
This graph is invalid because the cycle contains no local-memory primitive.
</p>

<h3>13.2 Valid cycle with <code>frog.core.delay</code></h3>

    ]
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
This graph is valid in principle because the feedback path contains an explicit local-memory primitive.
</p>

<h3>13.3 Self-feedback with explicit memory</h3>

<pre><code class="language-json">{
  "diagram": {
    "nodes": [

    ]
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
This is a valid feedback cycle in principle because the self-referential path remains explicit and includes local memory.
</p>

<h3>13.4 Region-local feedback inside a control structure</h3>

<p>
This example illustrates that the same explicit-local-memory rule applies inside a region-local diagram.
The presence of the loop structure does not replace the need for explicit local memory in the feedback path.

<h2 id="out-of-scope-for-v01">14. Out of Scope for v0.1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>implicit feedback state,</li>

<h2 id="summary">15. Summary</h2>

<p>
FROG allows feedback in executable diagrams, but only when memory is made explicit.
This document defines how that explicit memory and the resulting cycle-valid graph forms are represented in canonical source.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a directed cycle is representable in canonical source,</li>
  <li>it is only valid in principle when at least one explicit local-memory primitive appears in that directed cycle,</li>
  <li><code>frog.core.delay</code> is the minimal standard local-memory primitive for v0.1,</li>
  <li><code>initial</code> is mandatory for <code>frog.core.delay</code> in v0.1,</li>
  <li>local memory is scoped to the primitive instance and is not implicitly shared,</li>
  <li>normative execution semantics remain owned by <code>Language/State and cycles.md</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This gives FROG a clear, explicit, and verifiable source foundation for local memory and cycle-capable dataflow.
</p>
