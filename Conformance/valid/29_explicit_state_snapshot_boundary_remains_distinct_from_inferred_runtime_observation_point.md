<h2 id="case-name">1. Case Name</h2>

<p><strong>Case:</strong> <code>29_explicit_state_snapshot_boundary_remains_distinct_from_inferred_runtime_observation_point</code></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="expected">2. Expected</h2>

<p><strong>Expected:</strong> valid</p>

<p><strong>Expected meaning:</strong> language-level meaning is established.</p>

<p><strong>Expected preservation:</strong> an explicit state snapshot boundary remains semantically distinct from any observation point that an implementation might infer from runtime inspection timing, scheduler behavior, buffering strategy, or debug-oriented observation convenience.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="why">3. Why</h2>

<p>This case exists to make one boundary explicit:</p>

<pre><code>explicit state snapshot boundary
            !=
inferred runtime observation point
</code></pre>

<p>A conforming implementation may expose one or more convenient observation points for debugging, tracing, logging, runtime inspection, or host-side monitoring.</p>

<p>Those implementation conveniences do not become the source of semantic truth when the published program meaning already establishes an explicit boundary at which state is observed as a snapshot.</p>

<p>If the state snapshot boundary is explicit in validated program meaning, it must not later be replaced by whatever observation point happens to be convenient for one runtime.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="boundary-being-exercised">4. Boundary Being Exercised</h2>

<p>This case exercises the normative boundary:</p>

<pre><code>canonical .frog source
        |
        v
validated program meaning
</code></pre>

<p>It also exercises the preservation obligation across later layers:</p>

<pre><code>validated program meaning
        |
        v
derived execution-facing representation
        |
        v
lowering / backend / runtime realization
</code></pre>

<p>The distinction under test is between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a state snapshot boundary established by explicit language meaning, and</li>
  <li>an observation point merely inferred from one runtime inspection or monitoring strategy.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="scenario">5. Scenario</h2>

<p>A FROG program contains legal explicit state participation and one legal semantic boundary at which state is observed as a snapshot according to the validated program structure and state semantics.</p>

<p>The program is otherwise valid:</p>
<ul>
  <li>its graph is legal,</li>
  <li>its state usage is legal,</li>
  <li>its structure semantics are legal,</li>
  <li>its execution dependencies are explicit where required.</li>
</ul>

<p>The important property of this case is that the snapshot boundary is semantically attributable to validated program meaning itself. It is not left to one implementation’s inspection timing or runtime observation convenience.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-makes-the-case-valid">6. What Makes the Case Valid</h2>

<p>This case is valid because it does not rely on hidden runtime observation behavior to establish meaning.</p>

<p>Instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>state participation is explicit where required,</li>
  <li>the snapshot occurs within a valid semantic context,</li>
  <li>the relevant observation boundary is established by the validated program structure and state rules,</li>
  <li>the case does not require a conforming implementation to invent snapshot semantics from runtime inspection convenience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, validation succeeds and language-level meaning is established.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="expected-meaning">7. Expected Meaning</h2>

<p>If this case validates, the established meaning includes at least the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there is legal explicit state participation,</li>
  <li>there is a legal state snapshot boundary,</li>
  <li>the semantic significance of that snapshot boundary is part of validated program meaning where the published rules make it so,</li>
  <li>that boundary is not semantically interchangeable with whatever observation point one runtime happens to expose.</li>
</ul>

<p>The semantic reading is therefore:</p>

<pre><code>explicit state semantics
        +
explicit execution meaning
        -&gt;
validated state snapshot boundary
</code></pre>

<p>Not:</p>

<pre><code>runtime happens to expose one inspection point
        -&gt;
therefore that becomes language snapshot truth
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="expected-preservation">8. Expected Preservation</h2>

<p>A conforming implementation must preserve the distinction that this case establishes.</p>

<p>At minimum, later layers must not silently collapse:</p>
<ul>
  <li>explicit semantically established state snapshot boundary, into</li>
  <li>inferred runtime observation point.</li>
</ul>

<p>This does not require one frozen runtime inspection architecture.</p>

<p>It does require semantic faithfulness.</p>

<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li>derivation must not erase snapshot-relevant state distinctions that the validated meaning established,</li>
  <li>lowering must not reinterpret explicit snapshot semantics as mere observation convenience,</li>
  <li>backend contract generation must not silently replace semantic snapshot boundaries with unspecified monitoring behavior,</li>
  <li>runtime-private inspection or tracing points must not become the hidden owner of snapshot truth.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-must-not-happen">9. What Must Not Happen</h2>

<p>A conforming implementation must <strong>not</strong> do any of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat an explicit state snapshot boundary as semantically equivalent to one observed runtime inspection point,</li>
  <li>discard snapshot-relevant semantic distinctions during derivation and later substitute host-side observation convenience,</li>
  <li>claim semantic correctness merely because one runtime exposes a plausible state view,</li>
  <li>reinterpret source-established snapshot relationships as backend-private instrumentation detail,</li>
  <li>use runtime observation behavior to retroactively define language meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The forbidden collapse is:</p>

<pre><code>explicit state snapshot boundary
        -/-> inferred runtime observation point
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2 id="rationale">10. Rationale</h2>

<p>This distinction matters because state observation is one of the easiest places for hidden tooling and runtime behavior to silently redefine a language.</p>

<p>If inferred runtime observation points can replace explicit snapshot semantics, then:</p>
<ul>
  <li>program meaning becomes implementation-dependent,</li>
  <li>validation loses authority,</li>
  <li>debugging or monitoring convenience leaks upward into language truth,</li>
  <li>independent implementations may diverge while all appearing to expose “the same state”.</li>
</ul>

<p>FROG must keep the architectural rule explicit:</p>

<pre><code>validated semantic snapshot boundaries
            remain
above runtime observation convenience
</code></pre>

<p>This is necessary for inspectability, portability, reproducibility, and future independent implementations.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="minimum-conformance-reading">11. Minimum Conformance Reading</h2>

<p>A minimal conforming reading of this case is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source is valid,</li>
  <li>language-level meaning is established,</li>
  <li>the state snapshot boundary is semantically established where the published rules require it,</li>
  <li>that boundary remains distinct from inferred runtime observation point,</li>
  <li>later layers must preserve that distinction instead of silently laundering it away.</li>
</ul>

<p>The public truth asserted by this case is:</p>

<pre><code>explicit state snapshot boundary
            remains distinct from
inferred runtime observation point
</code></pre>
