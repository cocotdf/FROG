<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This case defines the second positive executable slice for a bounded Native CPU LLVM execution corridor.
</p>

<p>
It extends the first one-shot pure-core anchor by adding <strong>structured control</strong> while remaining intentionally conservative:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>one-shot execution only,</li>
  <li>no retained instance,</li>
  <li>no UI,</li>
  <li>no event-loop ownership,</li>
  <li>no external interop dependency,</li>
  <li>no runtime-mediated widget behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Its role is to make one additional public statement testable:
</p>

<pre>At least one bounded accepted FROG program
with explicit structured control
may be not only backend-family consumable,
but also execution-start ready,
normally terminating,
and observably correct
under a one-shot corridor.</pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="purpose">2. Purpose</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this case is to establish the first positive execution-ready anchor that proves more than straight-line pure computation.
</p>

<p>
It closes the next observable step after:
</p>

<pre>pure one-shot core executes correctly</pre>

<p>
by showing:
</p>

<pre>structured control
   +
bounded one-shot execution
   +
correct branch or control-path realization
   +
normal termination
   +
correct observable output</pre>

<p>
This case therefore exists to prove that executable conformance growth is not limited to arithmetic-only straight-line slices.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="status">3. Status</h2>

<p>
This case is intended as part of a future executable conformance family.
</p>

<p>
It should only be treated as fully published conformance once the repository also publishes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a profile-side execution contract for the bounded Native CPU LLVM execution-ready corridor,</li>
  <li>the containing <code>Conformance/valid/executable/</code> family,</li>
  <li>the companion case assets required by the published conformance format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Until then, it should be read as a coherent draft-to-add aligned with the currently published compiler-corridor architecture. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="corridor-covered">4. Corridor Covered</h2>

<p>
This case covers the following corridor:
</p>

<pre>.frog source
   -&gt;
structural acceptance
   -&gt;
semantic acceptance
   -&gt;
canonical Execution IR
   -&gt;
lowering
   -&gt;
backend contract
   -&gt;
execution-contract satisfaction
   -&gt;
one-shot execution start
   -&gt;
structured control executes correctly
   -&gt;
normal termination
   -&gt;
observable output match</pre>

<p>
It is therefore the smallest positive executable corridor slice in which control-path correctness is part of the public truth.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="case-intent">5. Case Intent</h2>

<p>
This case asserts that a bounded accepted structured-control program:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>belongs to the accepted Native CPU LLVM compilation subset,</li>
  <li>satisfies the companion execution contract,</li>
  <li>can be instantiated without hidden runtime services,</li>
  <li>can start in one-shot mode,</li>
  <li>can realize the intended structured-control path correctly,</li>
  <li>can terminate normally,</li>
  <li>can expose the expected outputs at completion.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This case is intentionally not broader than that.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="required-upstream-assumptions">6. Required Upstream Assumptions</h2>

<p>
A conforming implementation may only claim this case if all of the following are true:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source is canonical where required,</li>
  <li>the program is semantically accepted,</li>
  <li>structured control is preserved correctly across derivation,</li>
  <li>canonical Execution IR has been derived faithfully,</li>
  <li>the lowered form remains valid for the Native CPU LLVM profile,</li>
  <li>a backend contract has been emitted successfully,</li>
  <li>the execution unit is explicit,</li>
  <li>the execution mode is explicit and one-shot,</li>
  <li>no undeclared host-service dependency exists,</li>
  <li>no UI runtime dependency exists,</li>
  <li>no retained-instance semantics are required.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="program-shape">7. Program Shape</h2>

<p>
The intended program shape is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bounded pure or mostly pure executable core,</li>
  <li>with explicit structured control,</li>
  <li>with one clear accepted input/output boundary,</li>
  <li>with no UI nodes,</li>
  <li>with no widget references,</li>
  <li>with no external interop call,</li>
  <li>with no asynchronous continuation semantics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Typical candidate forms include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a boolean case selecting one of two pure computation paths,</li>
  <li>a bounded single control structure whose selected path affects the final observable output,</li>
  <li>a simple loop form whose one-shot completion remains deterministic and bounded.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="structured-control-focus">8. Structured-Control Focus</h2>

<p>
The public truth exposed by this case is not merely that the program “runs”.
</p>

<p>
It is that the structured-control meaning remains correct through the executable corridor.
</p>

<p>
That means the conforming implementation must preserve, at the execution-visible level:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the intended control selection,</li>
  <li>the intended path-sensitive data transformation,</li>
  <li>the intended final observable result of that selected control path.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Compactly:
</p>

<pre>accepted structured control
   -&gt;
correct lowered executable control behavior
   -&gt;
correct observable result</pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="execution-mode">9. Execution Mode</h2>

<p>
This case is strictly one-shot.
</p>

<p>
That means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the execution unit is instantiated,</li>
  <li>any required initialization is performed,</li>
  <li>execution starts once,</li>
  <li>the structured-control region executes within that one-shot run,</li>
  <li>outputs become externally visible at completion,</li>
  <li>the execution unit terminates normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This case does not admit:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>step mode,</li>
  <li>retained-instance mode,</li>
  <li>interactive continuation,</li>
  <li>event-loop-driven structured control.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="expected-behavior">10. Expected Behavior</h2>

<p>
A conforming implementation is expected to produce the following behavior:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>accept the source and semantic shape,</li>
  <li>derive canonical Execution IR correctly,</li>
  <li>preserve the structured-control commitments correctly through lowering,</li>
  <li>emit a valid backend contract,</li>
  <li>satisfy the execution-contract preconditions,</li>
  <li>start execution successfully,</li>
  <li>execute the intended structured-control path correctly,</li>
  <li>terminate normally,</li>
  <li>produce the expected observable outputs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The expected public truth is therefore:
</p>

<pre>accepted
   +
execution-start succeeds
   +
structured control behaves correctly
   +
normal termination
   +
observable outputs match expectation</pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="expected-conformance-outcome">11. Expected Conformance Outcome</h2>

<p>
The expected conformance outcome for this case is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at source level,</li>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at semantic level,</li>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at IR derivation level,</li>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at lowering level,</li>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at backend-contract level,</li>
  <li><strong>not rejected</strong> at execution-contract level,</li>
  <li><strong>not faulting</strong> during startup,</li>
  <li><strong>normally terminating</strong> under one-shot execution,</li>
  <li><strong>control-correct</strong> and <strong>output-correct</strong> at the observable boundary.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-this-case-does-not-test">12. What This Case Does Not Test</h2>

<p>
This case does not test:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>UI execution readiness,</li>
  <li>widget-object semantics,</li>
  <li>event-loop ownership,</li>
  <li>external interop execution,</li>
  <li>retained-instance semantics,</li>
  <li>step-mode control advancement,</li>
  <li>real-time guarantees,</li>
  <li>multi-thread scheduling guarantees,</li>
  <li>runtime-mediated host services beyond the minimal declared execution surface.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That restriction is deliberate. This case is meant to anchor structured control as the next minimal positive executable slice after the pure-core one-shot case.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="future-companion-material">13. Future Companion Material</h2>

<p>
A fully published version of this case should later be accompanied by repository-visible assets such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical source file,</li>
  <li>the expected IR representation where applicable,</li>
  <li>the expected lowered form where applicable,</li>
  <li>the expected backend contract where applicable,</li>
  <li>the expected observable execution result,</li>
  <li>any machine-checkable metadata required by the published conformance format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For this case in particular, the expected material should make the selected structured-control behavior and final observable output unambiguous.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="summary">14. Summary</h2>

<p>
This case defines the second positive executable conformance slice for a bounded Native CPU LLVM corridor.
</p>

<p>
It proves one thing cleanly:
</p>

<pre>a structured-control FROG core
may pass
from accepted source
to accepted execution start
to correct one-shot control behavior
to normal termination
with correct observable output</pre>

<p>
That is the intended role of
<code>02_structured_control_one_shot_executes_correctly</code>
in a future executable conformance family.
</p>
