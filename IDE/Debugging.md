<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This document defines the <strong>interactive debugging behavior</strong> of a FROG IDE.
It specifies how an IDE may pause, resume, inspect, and step through a live execution instance in a <strong>source-aligned</strong> way.
</p>

<p>
This document does <strong>not</strong> define execution semantics.
Execution meaning remains defined by the validated executable graph and by the relevant language, library, and profile specifications.
This document standardizes only the IDE-facing control meaning needed for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>run-under-debug behavior,</li>
  <li>manual pause and resume,</li>
  <li>user-facing abort,</li>
  <li>breakpoints,</li>
  <li>single-step commands,</li>
  <li>fault-directed pause when supported,</li>
  <li>source-aligned debug inspection.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Language/
    -&gt; owns execution meaning and safe debug stops

IR/
    -&gt; owns execution-facing derivation and identity preservation posture

IDE/Observability.md
    -&gt; owns the observable projection consumed by tools

IDE/Debugging.md
    -&gt; owns interactive debug control meaning for the IDE
</code></pre>

<p>
Interactive debugging is therefore a tooling-facing layer over already-defined execution meaning.
It is not a replacement for the execution model, not a replacement for safe-boundary semantics, and not a runtime-internal scheduler specification.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="document-role">2. Document Role</h2>

<p>
This document is the debugging-focused document of the <code>IDE/</code> family.
Its role is to define how a conforming IDE exposes interactive debug control over live execution that has already been made observable in source-aligned form.
</p>

<p>
This document should be read together with:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>IDE/Readme.md</code> for the overall IDE architecture,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Observability.md</code> for the live source-aligned observability layer,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Probes.md</code> for local inspection surfaces,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Watch.md</code> for persistent centralized inspection,</li>
  <li><code>IR/Execution IR.md</code> and related IR documents for execution-facing identity and attribution posture.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document is intentionally modular.
It defines debugging control meaning only.
It does not absorb observability, probe, watch, IR, or language ownership.
</p>

</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="design-principles">6. Design Principles</h2>

<h3>6.1 Source-level debugging</h3>

<p>
Debugging MUST be expressed in terms of source-visible concepts:
nodes, edges, structures, regions, sub-FROG calls, local-memory observations, probes, watches, and widget-related execution objects when relevant.
The user MUST NOT be required to reason about runtime-private artifacts.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Dataflow-first behavior</h3>

<p>
FROG debugging MUST respect dataflow semantics.
It MUST NOT assume an implicit sequential instruction stream.
Debugging controls therefore operate over source-aligned observable execution activity.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Language-derived safe boundaries</h3>

<p>
A visible debugger stop MUST occur only at a language-valid safe debug stop.
The debugger MUST NOT expose a partially committed source-level state as if it were stable.
This document consumes that guarantee; it does not define it.
</p>

<h3>6.4 Runtime independence</h3>

<p>
Different runtimes MAY implement debugging through different internal mechanisms.
The source-level meaning exposed to the IDE MUST remain equivalent.
</p>

<h3>6.5 Observability-first dependency</h3>

<p>
Interactive debugging in FROG depends on source-aligned observability.
A debugger MAY control execution only to the extent that execution has already been projected into meaningful FROG objects.
</p>

<h3>6.6 Probe and watch compatibility</h3>

<p>
Debugging SHOULD compose cleanly with probes and watches.
A paused snapshot, step completion, breakpoint hit, or fault-directed pause MUST remain interpretable by probe and watch consumers without contradictory source state.
</p>

<h3>6.7 Minimal but extensible</h3>

<p>
FROG defines a minimal interactive debugging core.
Stronger debugging support levels MAY expose richer controls, additional breakpoint conditions, or deeper inspection capabilities, provided that the standardized meanings defined here remain preserved.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="debug-session-model">7. Debug Session Model</h2>

<h3>7.1 Definition</h3>

<p>
A <strong>debug session</strong> is the IDE-visible control context attached to one live execution instance.
A debug session owns the active debugger configuration for that instance.
</p>

<p>
A debug session conceptually contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the target <code>instance_id</code>,</li>
  <li>the current debug-session state,</li>
  <li>the current pause reason when paused,</li>
  <li>the active breakpoint set,</li>
  <li>the currently selected source-aligned object,</li>
  <li>the relevant execution context,</li>
  <li>the active step request if one exists.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.2 Debug-session states</h3>

<p>
A debug session MUST expose one of the following high-level states:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>idle</code> — no live execution instance is attached,</li>
  <li><code>starting</code> — execution is being prepared under debug control,</li>
  <li><code>running</code> — execution is progressing under an active debug session,</li>
  <li><code>paused</code> — execution is suspended at a language-valid safe debug stop,</li>
  <li><code>completed</code> — the instance finished normally,</li>
  <li><code>faulted</code> — the instance terminated because of a fault without remaining paused,</li>
  <li><code>aborted</code> — the instance terminated because of a user or external abort action.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 Pause reasons</h3>

<p>
When a debug session is paused, the primary pause reason SHOULD be available.
Canonical pause reasons are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>manual_pause</code>,</li>
  <li><code>breakpoint</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_complete</code>,</li>
  <li><code>fault</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.4 Selected object and context</h3>

<p>
When paused, the debugger SHOULD identify one primary selected source-aligned object.
That object MAY be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a node,</li>
  <li>an edge,</li>
  <li>a structure,</li>
  <li>a region,</li>
  <li>a sub-FROG call site,</li>
  <li>a widget-related execution object,</li>
  <li>another supported source-aligned execution object.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The selected object is a debugger-facing focus object.
It does not replace the full execution context, which MUST remain available when needed to interpret:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>loop iteration identity,</li>
  <li>selected region identity,</li>
  <li>caller/callee nesting,</li>
  <li>repeated activations of the same source node.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="pause-resume-and-abort">8. Pause, Resume, and Abort</h2>

<h3>8.1 Manual pause</h3>

<p>
A manual pause request asks the runtime to suspend execution at the next language-valid safe debug stop.
</p>

<p>
When the session becomes paused, the IDE-facing view MUST be interpretable as a <strong>pause-consistent snapshot</strong>.
In particular, the debugger MUST be able to rely on the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>already-visible node completions are committed,</li>
  <li>already-visible edge values are committed,</li>
  <li>already-visible local-memory updates are committed,</li>
  <li>the visible structure and region context is coherent,</li>
  <li>the paused state corresponds to a coherent causal prefix.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.2 Resume</h3>

<p>
A resume request restarts execution from the current paused state.
Unless a step request is active, execution continues freely until one of the following occurs:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a breakpoint is hit,</li>
  <li>a fault-directed pause occurs,</li>
  <li>the user pauses manually again,</li>
  <li>the instance completes normally,</li>
  <li>the instance is aborted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.3 Abort</h3>

<p>
A user-facing stop action terminates the live execution instance.
At the debugging level, that outcome MUST be represented consistently with the instance becoming <code>aborted</code>, unless a stronger implementation defines an explicitly different but equivalent user-stop presentation.
</p>

<h3>8.4 Inspection during pause</h3>

<p>
While paused, the IDE MAY expose:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the selected source object,</li>
  <li>the current execution context,</li>
  <li>relevant committed values,</li>
  <li>relevant committed local-memory state,</li>
  <li>probe and watch views defined elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All such inspection MUST remain consistent with the paused execution snapshot exposed to the IDE.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="breakpoints">9. Breakpoints</h2>

<h3>9.1 General model</h3>

<p>
A breakpoint is a debugger-facing stop condition attached to a source-aligned execution object.
When its condition is satisfied, execution MUST pause only at a corresponding language-valid safe debug stop.
</p>

<p>
Breakpoint triggering is evaluated in source-aligned terms.
It MUST NOT require exposing runtime-private execution artifacts to the user.
</p>

<h3>9.2 Minimum interactive baseline</h3>

<p>
The <strong>minimum interactive debugging baseline</strong> requires support for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>node_breakpoint</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>9.3 Optional standardized breakpoint kinds</h3>

<p>
Additional standardized breakpoint kinds MAY include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>edge_breakpoint</code>,</li>
  <li><code>structure_breakpoint</code>,</li>
  <li><code>subfrog_breakpoint</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.4 Node breakpoint</h3>

<p>
A node breakpoint is attached to one source node.
The canonical baseline condition is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>on_start</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
Stronger implementations MAY additionally support:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>on_ready</code>,</li>
  <li><code>on_complete</code>,</li>
  <li><code>on_fault</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.5 Edge breakpoint</h3>

<p>
An edge breakpoint is attached to one source edge.
Its standardized meaning is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>pause when a value becomes available on that edge in the relevant execution context.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.6 Structure breakpoint</h3>

<p>
A structure breakpoint is attached to one structure node.
Its standardized meaning is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>pause when that structure activation begins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.7 Sub-FROG breakpoint</h3>

<p>
A sub-FROG breakpoint is attached to one <code>subfrog</code> call site.
Its standardized meaning is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>pause when that call-site activation begins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.8 Enabled and disabled breakpoints</h3>

<p>
A breakpoint MAY be enabled or disabled without being removed.
A disabled breakpoint MUST have no effect on execution.
</p>

<h3>9.9 Multiple simultaneous matches</h3>

<p>
If multiple breakpoint conditions are satisfied at the same safe debug stop, the runtime MAY report one primary breakpoint cause and additional matched breakpoints.
The IDE MUST NOT present contradictory source state.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="stepping-model">10. Stepping Model</h2>

<h3>10.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
Single-stepping in FROG is defined over <strong>source-aligned observable execution</strong>, not over a linear instruction stream.
A step request resumes execution in a constrained way until the first <strong>eligible safe debug stop</strong> for that request is reached.
</p>

<h3>10.2 Eligible safe debug stop</h3>

<p>
An eligible safe debug stop is a language-valid safe debug stop that also satisfies the IDE-facing selection rule of the active step command.
The step command defines the selection rule.
The language defines where safe debug stops may exist.
</p>

<pre><code>step request issued by IDE
        |
        v
runtime continues execution
        |
        v
language-valid safe debug stops become reachable
        |
        v
first stop matching the step-selection rule
        |
        v
debug session pauses
</code></pre>

<h3>10.3 Canonical step commands</h3>

<p>
The canonical step commands are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>step_into</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_over</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_out</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>10.4 <code>step_into</code></h3>

<p>
<code>step_into</code> resumes execution until the first eligible safe debug stop on the current causally reachable execution path.
When the current paused object represents a nested executable unit, <code>step_into</code> MAY stop inside that nested scope.
</p>

<h3>10.5 <code>step_over</code></h3>

<p>
<code>step_over</code> treats the currently selected source-aligned executable unit as one debugger-facing unit.
It resumes execution until that currently selected unit has completed from the point of view of its immediate parent scope, then pauses at the first eligible safe debug stop in that parent scope.
</p>

<h3>10.6 <code>step_out</code></h3>

<p>
<code>step_out</code> is valid only when the current paused location is inside a nested debug scope.
It resumes execution until the current nested scope has completed from the point of view of its immediate parent scope, then pauses at the first eligible safe debug stop in that parent scope.
</p>

<h3>10.7 Step completion</h3>

<p>
When a step request succeeds normally, the resulting pause reason SHOULD be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>step_complete</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If a breakpoint is hit before the intended step target is reached, the pause reason MAY be <code>breakpoint</code>.
If a fault-directed pause occurs, the pause reason MUST be <code>fault</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="nested-scope-debugging">11. Nested-Scope Debugging</h2>

<h3>11.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
FROG debugging is scope-aware.
A paused location may belong to a nested source-aligned execution scope, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sub-FROG invocation scope,</li>
  <li>a selected structure region,</li>
  <li>a loop iteration context,</li>
  <li>another nested dynamic scope exposed by a stronger implementation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The debugger SHOULD preserve that nesting explicitly in the visible execution context.
</p>

<h3>11.2 Sub-FROG scopes</h3>

<p>
A <code>subfrog</code> node creates a nested source-aligned call scope for debugging purposes.
Therefore:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>step_into</code> MAY enter the nested sub-FROG scope,</li>
  <li><code>step_over</code> MUST treat the call as one caller-visible unit,</li>
  <li><code>step_out</code> from inside the callee MUST return to the caller scope.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.3 Case structures</h3>

<p>
For a <code>case</code> structure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>only the selected region belongs to the active dynamic path for that activation,</li>
  <li><code>step_into</code> MAY stop at selected-region entry or at the first eligible stop inside it,</li>
  <li><code>step_over</code> MUST execute the selected region as one structure activation and return to the parent scope,</li>
  <li><code>step_out</code> from inside the selected region MUST continue until the structure activation completes and then return to the parent scope.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.4 Loop structures</h3>

<p>
Loop debugging is iteration-aware.
The same source node MAY therefore appear repeatedly under distinct iteration contexts.
The IDE SHOULD preserve iteration identity while debugging.
</p>

<h3>11.5 Local memory inside nested scopes</h3>

<p>
When local-memory primitives are active inside nested scopes, the debugger MUST preserve the source meaning of local state for the current live execution instance.
A paused view MUST NOT misrepresent stored state across iterations or nested activations.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="execution-highlighting">12. Execution Highlighting</h2>

<h3>12.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
A debugging-capable IDE SHOULD support execution highlighting.
Execution highlighting is the source-level visual projection of live execution activity onto the diagram.
</p>

<h3>12.2 Highlightable objects</h3>

<p>
An IDE SHOULD be able to highlight at least:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>node execution start,</li>
  <li>node execution completion,</li>
  <li>edge value availability,</li>
  <li>structure entry,</li>
  <li>selected case regions,</li>
  <li>loop iteration progression.</li>
</ul>

<h3>12.3 Meaning of highlighting</h3>

<p>
Highlighting is descriptive, not prescriptive.
It visualizes execution activity already made observable to the IDE.
It MUST NOT alter execution meaning.
</p>

<h3>12.4 No mandatory rendering style</h3>

<p>
This specification does not require a particular animation model, color model, line style, or theme.
Any rendering strategy is acceptable provided that the displayed meaning remains source-aligned and understandable.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="fault-handling-during-debugging">13. Fault Handling During Debugging</h2>

<h3>13.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
If a fault occurs while debugging is active, the debug session SHOULD pause at the most relevant language-valid safe debug stop associated with that fault when the active implementation supports fault-directed pause.
</p>

<p>
The debug-session state MUST then become either:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>paused</code> with pause reason <code>fault</code>, or</li>
  <li><code>faulted</code> if the implementation does not support fault-directed pause before termination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>13.2 Fault localization</h3>

<p>
When possible, the IDE SHOULD identify at least one primary source object related to the fault, such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a node,</li>
  <li>a structure,</li>
  <li>a sub-FROG call site,</li>
  <li>a widget interaction node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>13.3 Consistency rule</h3>

<p>
Fault-directed pause MUST still obey language-level safe debug-stop rules.
The debugger MUST NOT show a contradictory partial state merely because the pause reason is <code>fault</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="front-panel-and-widget-debug-visibility">14. Front Panel and Widget Debug Visibility</h2>

<h3>14.1 Widget-related execution objects</h3>

<p>
Widget participation in debugging occurs through the diagram-level execution objects already defined by source and consumed through the relevant primitive contracts, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>widget_value</code>,</li>
  <li><code>widget_reference</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_read</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_write</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.method_invoke</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>14.2 Front-panel reflection</h3>

<p>
A debugging-capable IDE MAY reflect debug state on the front panel when that reflection is source-meaningful.
Examples include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>showing the current widget value when relevant,</li>
  <li>showing that a property write has occurred,</li>
  <li>showing the result of a property read,</li>
  <li>showing explicit UI-effect sequencing progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the front panel remains a user-facing UI composition, not the authoritative executable graph.
Pause locations and step targets therefore remain defined primarily in diagram terms.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relationship-with-probes-and-watches">15. Relationship with Probes and Watches</h2>

<p>
Debugging is not identical to probes or watches, but it must compose with both.
The architectural relation is:
</p>

<pre><code>live execution
      |
      v
source-aligned observability
      |
      +--&gt; debugging control
      +--&gt; probes
      \--&gt; watches
</code></pre>

<h3>15.1 Probes</h3>

<p>
Probes are local inspection objects attached to graph-meaningful surfaces.
During debugging, probes SHOULD remain interpretable against the same paused snapshot and the same selected execution context as the debugger.
</p>

<h3>15.2 Watches</h3>

<p>
Watches are persistent centralized observation surfaces.
During debugging, watches SHOULD remain attributable to meaningful source objects and SHOULD update consistently with pause, resume, step completion, and fault-directed pause.
</p>

<h3>15.3 Non-ownership rule</h3>

<p>
This document does not define probe behavior or watch behavior in full.
It defines only the compatibility requirements between debugger control and those inspection layers.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="ide-requirements">16. IDE Requirements</h2>

<h3>16.1 Minimum interactive debugging baseline</h3>

<p>
An IDE that claims support for FROG interactive debugging SHOULD provide at least:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>run under debug control,</li>
  <li>manual pause and resume,</li>
  <li>manual abort,</li>
  <li>execution highlighting,</li>
  <li><code>node_breakpoint</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_into</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_over</code>,</li>
  <li><code>step_out</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>16.2 Optional standardized additions</h3>

<p>
An IDE MAY additionally provide:
</p>

<h2 id="summary">19. Summary</h2>

<p>
FROG interactive debugging defines the IDE-facing meaning of pause, resume, abort, breakpoints, and stepping for live executions of FROG programs.
It preserves the dataflow nature of the language and avoids imposing a false sequential execution model.
</p>

<p>
This debugging layer provides the foundation for richer inspection tooling while preserving the architectural separation between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>execution semantics,</li>
  <li>execution-facing attribution,</li>
  <li>observable execution projection,</li>
  <li>interactive debugger control,</li>
  <li>probe and watch consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The practical reading is simple:
debugging in FROG is source-aligned, dataflow-first, observability-dependent, and compatible with probes and watches without collapsing those concerns into one document.
</p>
