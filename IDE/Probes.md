<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This document defines the <strong>probe model</strong> of a FROG IDE.
A probe is an <strong>IDE-managed, source-attached inspection object</strong> associated with one
source-visible execution target so that a user can inspect source-aligned execution observations.
</p>

<p>
A probe does <strong>not</strong> redefine execution semantics.
It consumes the source-aligned observability already exposed to the IDE and presents that information
in a local inspection form suitable for diagram-centric workflows.
</p>

<p>
For FROG v0.1, probes are primarily designed to make ordinary dataflow understandable at the level of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>edges,</li>
  <li>node ports when needed,</li>
  <li>local-memory state when supported,</li>
  <li>certain UI-related execution objects under compatible observability support.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>execution-facing systems
        |
        v
execution observability
        |
        +-----------+-----------+
        |                       |
        v                       v
   local probe             centralized watch
 source-attached         persistent list entry
 diagram-centric         monitoring-centric
</code></pre>

<p>
A probe therefore belongs to the <strong>IDE inspection layer</strong>.
It may be used together with debugging, but it is not itself a debugger control object.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="scope-for-v01">2. Scope for v0.1</h2>

<p>
For FROG v0.1, this document standardizes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what a probe is,</li>
  <li>which source-visible execution objects may be probed,</li>
  <li>the minimum probe baseline and optional standardized probe kinds,</li>
  <li>the meaning of the last-known committed observation,</li>
  <li>the distinction between live, paused, and retained probe views,</li>
  <li>minimal probe-management behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document does <strong>not</strong> standardize:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a specific probe window layout,</li>
  <li>conditional break behavior driven by probes,</li>
  <li>watch expressions,</li>
  <li>a mandatory history buffer for every probe,</li>
  <li>time-series visualization for every type,</li>
  <li>distributed multi-runtime probe coordination,</li>
  <li>reverse-time probe inspection,</li>
  <li>a mandatory serialization format for all values.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="architectural-position-and-dependencies">3. Architectural Position and Dependencies</h2>

<h3>3.1 Repository position</h3>

<p>
This document belongs in <code>IDE/</code> because it defines how an IDE inspects execution through
source-attached probe objects.
It does <strong>not</strong> belong to <code>Language/</code> because it does not own execution meaning.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Dependencies</h3>

<p>
This document depends on the following specifications:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>IDE/Readme.md</code> — architectural role of observability, debugging, probes, and watches in the IDE layer,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Execution observability.md</code> — source-aligned observable projection consumed by probes,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Debugging.md</code> — pause, resume, stepping, and breakpoint behavior used together with probes,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Watch.md</code> — centralized persistent inspection behavior distinct from probes,</li>
  <li><code>Expression/Diagram.md</code> — canonical node, port, and edge representation,</li>
  <li><code>Expression/State and cycles.md</code> — source-facing local-memory representation,</li>
  <li><code>Expression/Widget interaction.md</code> — explicit UI sequencing through <code>ui_in</code> and <code>ui_out</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Language/Execution model.md</code> — execution context and committed source-level execution meaning,</li>
  <li><code>Language/Execution control and observation boundaries.md</code> — safe observation boundaries and pause-consistent snapshots,</li>
  <li><code>Language/State and cycles.md</code> — normative local-memory and cycle behavior,</li>
  <li><code>Libraries/Core.md</code> — primitive-local behavior such as <code>frog.core.delay</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Libraries/UI.md</code> — standardized executable UI interaction primitives.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Ownership boundary</h3>

<p>
If a conflict appears, the following ownership rules apply:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Expression/</code> remains authoritative for source-visible targets and canonical source identity,</li>
  <li><code>Language/</code> remains authoritative for execution meaning, committed state, and safe observation boundaries,</li>
  <li><code>Libraries/</code> remain authoritative for primitive-local meaning and primitive surfaces,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Debugging.md</code> remains authoritative for debugger controls,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Watch.md</code> remains authoritative for centralized persistent watch behavior,</li>
  <li><code>IDE/Probes.md</code> remains authoritative only for source-attached probe behavior and meaning.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Expression/
    owns what is source-visible and serializable

Language/
    owns what execution means and when it is safe to observe

Libraries/
    own primitive-local executable meaning

IDE/Execution observability.md
    owns the observable projection exposed to tools

IDE/Probes.md
    owns local source-attached inspection behavior
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="design-principles">4. Design Principles</h2>

<h3>4.1 Source-attached inspection</h3>

<p>
A probe MUST attach to a source-visible execution target.
A probe MUST NOT require the user to understand runtime-private buffers, queues, or scheduler artifacts.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Non-intrusive observation</h3>

<p>
A standard probe MUST NOT change program semantics.
Adding, removing, opening, or closing a probe MUST NOT alter the meaning of the FROG graph.
</p>

<h3>4.3 Committed observations only</h3>

<p>
Probe-visible values or states MUST correspond to committed source-level observations.
A probe MUST NOT present speculative, half-updated, or otherwise incoherent source meaning as stable.
</p>

<h3>4.4 Dataflow-first model</h3>

<p>
Because FROG is dataflow-based, the canonical first-class probe target in v0.1 is the
<strong>source edge</strong>.
This preserves the natural inspection model of observing values as they become available in the graph.
</p>

<h3>4.5 Local rather than centralized inspection</h3>

<p>
A probe is defined by <strong>local source attachment</strong>.
It is not the same thing as a centralized persistent watch entry.
A probe MAY be rendered inline, near its target, or in a detachable local view,
but its semantic identity remains target-local.
</p>

<h3>4.6 Debug-compatible but not debug-owned</h3>

<p>
Probes MAY be used during free-running execution, during a paused debug session,
or in a retained post-execution view when supported.
They are compatible with debugging, but they are not owned by the debugger command model.
</p>

<h3>4.7 Capability profiles and observability profiles remain distinct</h3>

<p>
The repository uses <code>Profiles/</code> for optional standardized executable capability families.
This document may also refer to stronger or weaker probe support through observability support.
These notions MUST NOT be conflated.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a capability profile defines what executable capability families exist,</li>
  <li>an observability profile defines how much source-aligned execution detail is exposed to probes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4.8 Minimal but extensible</h3>

<p>
FROG v0.1 defines a minimal probe core.
Stronger observability support MAY expose richer rendering, richer history, type-specific visualization,
or custom probe forms, provided that the base semantic meaning remains preserved.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="probe-model">5. Probe Model</h2>

<h3>5.1 Definition</h3>

<p>
A probe is an IDE-managed inspection object associated with exactly one primary target.
It receives compatible source-aligned observations and presents a user-facing inspection view of them.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Conceptual fields</h3>

<p>
Conceptually, a probe contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a probe identifier,</li>
  <li>a primary target,</li>
  <li>a probe kind,</li>
  <li>a current probe-entry state,</li>
  <li>a last-known compatible observation when available,</li>
  <li>the relevant execution context for that observation when needed,</li>
  <li>an IDE-chosen display strategy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Outside the canonical source</h3>

<p>
A probe is not part of the canonical FROG Expression.
It is an IDE-side inspection construct layered over execution observability or retained post-execution inspection.
Creating or removing a probe MUST NOT modify the source program.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="probes-vs-watches">6. Probes vs Watches</h2>

<p>
Probes and watches consume the same underlying observability space, but they serve different workflows.
</p>

<pre><code>same underlying observations
        |
        +----------------------+----------------------+
        |                                             |
        v                                             v
      probe                                         watch
  local attachment                           centralized persistence
  target-centric                              list-centric
  diagram-centric                          monitoring-centric
</code></pre>

<h3>6.1 Probe</h3>

<p>
A probe is primarily local and target-centric.
It is typically used near the source-visible object being inspected and is naturally diagram-centric.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Watch</h3>

<p>
A watch is primarily persistent and centralized.
It belongs to a watch list or equivalent IDE-managed collection intended for cross-navigation and longer-lived monitoring.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Relationship</h3>

<p>
An IDE MAY allow:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>creating a probe from a source target,</li>
  <li>creating a watch from a source target,</li>
  <li>creating a watch from an existing probe target,</li>
  <li>creating a probe from an existing watch target.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, a probe MUST NOT be treated as merely a differently rendered watch.
Its defining property is source attachment.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="probe-target-model">7. Probe Target Model</h2>

<h3>7.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
A probe MUST attach to exactly one primary source-visible target.
For v0.1, a primary probe target MAY be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a source edge,</li>
  <li>a source node input port,</li>
  <li>a source node output port,</li>
  <li>a local-memory slot owned by a local-memory node instance,</li>
  <li>a stricter-profile target that remains source-visible and semantically well-defined.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.2 Execution context</h3>

<p>
When repeated observations of the same target would otherwise be ambiguous,
a probe MUST preserve sufficient execution context to disambiguate them.
Relevant context MAY include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>execution instance identity,</li>
  <li>sub-FROG stack,</li>
  <li>structure nesting,</li>
  <li>selected region identity,</li>
  <li>loop iteration identity,</li>
  <li>activation identity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.3 Target-local meaning</h3>

<p>
A probe target defines <strong>where</strong> inspection is attached.
The active observability profile defines <strong>how much</strong> compatible observation can actually be exposed for that target.
</p>

<pre><code>probe entry
  ├── primary target
  │     └── edge / port / local_memory / stricter-profile target
  ├── latest compatible observation
  │     └── committed value or committed state snapshot
  └── execution context
        ├── instance
        ├── subfrog stack
        ├── structure stack
        ├── selected region
        ├── iteration
        └── activation id
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="probe-kinds">8. Probe Kinds</h2>

<h3>8.1 Minimum baseline</h3>

<p>
For FROG v0.1, the <strong>minimum probe baseline</strong> requires support for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>edge_probe</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
This is the only required probe kind for a minimal conforming probe implementation.
</p>

<h3>8.2 Optional standardized probe kinds</h3>

<p>
FROG v0.1 additionally standardizes the following optional probe kinds:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>port_probe</code>,</li>
  <li><code>local_memory_probe</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These kinds are standardized so that compatible implementations can expose the same meanings,
but they are not part of the minimum baseline.
</p>

<h3>8.3 Stronger-profile additions</h3>

<p>
A stronger observability profile MAY additionally support:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ui_sequence_probe</code>,</li>
  <li><code>structure_probe</code>,</li>
  <li><code>custom_probe</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.4 Priority of ordinary dataflow inspection</h3>

<p>
Among all probe forms, <code>edge_probe</code> is the canonical and most important probe kind for v0.1.
It is the primary inspection form for ordinary dataflow values.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="probe-lifecycle-and-states">9. Probe Lifecycle and States</h2>

<h3>9.1 Creation</h3>

<p>
A probe is created when the IDE attaches a new probe object to a valid target.
Creation MUST fail if the requested target is not a valid probe target under the active observability support.
</p>

<h3>9.2 Probe-entry states</h3>

<p>
A probe MAY conceptually be in one of the following states:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>created</code> — the probe exists but has not yet received a compatible observation,</li>
  <li><code>live</code> — the probe is receiving live execution updates,</li>
  <li><code>paused</code> — the probe reflects a paused consistent snapshot,</li>
  <li><code>retained</code> — the probe shows a retained post-execution observation when supported,</li>
  <li><code>unavailable</code> — the target exists but no compatible observation is currently available,</li>
  <li><code>closed</code> — the probe has been removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are probe-entry states.
They MUST NOT be confused with the execution state of the underlying live instance.
</p>

<h3>9.3 Removal</h3>

<p>
Removing a probe affects only the inspection layer.
It MUST NOT alter the graph, execution semantics, source identity, or debugger control state.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="observation-semantics">10. Observation Semantics</h2>

<h3>10.1 General rule</h3>

<p>
A probe does not invent values.
It displays values or source-aligned state only when those observations become available through the observability model exposed to the IDE.
</p>

<h3>10.2 Last-known committed observation</h3>

<p>
For v0.1, the primary semantic model of a probe is the
<strong>last-known committed observation</strong>.
This means the most recent committed source-level value or state snapshot observed for the probe target
in the relevant execution context.
</p>

<h3>10.3 Multiple observations over time</h3>

<p>
If a probe target receives multiple compatible observations over time, the base v0.1 model requires that the probe
be able to show at least the most recent one.
A stronger profile MAY additionally retain a bounded history or a richer time-oriented representation.
</p>

<h3>10.4 Value previews and full values</h3>

<p>
A runtime is not required to expose a fully materialized value for every observation.
A probe MAY therefore display:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a full value snapshot,</li>
  <li>a summarized preview,</li>
  <li>a type-aware rendering,</li>
  <li>an opaque placeholder indicating availability without a full displayable value.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whatever rendering strategy is used, the semantic meaning MUST remain that the probe refers to a compatible
committed observation for its target.
</p>

<h3>10.5 No fabricated values</h3>

<p>
If no compatible committed observation exists yet, the probe MUST remain unavailable rather than implying that a value exists.
</p>

<h3>10.6 No fabricated history</h3>

<p>
A probe MUST NOT imply that a full historical sequence exists unless such history is actually preserved by the active observability support.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="live-paused-and-retained-views">11. Live, Paused, and Retained Views</h2>

<pre><code>running execution
      |
      ├── compatible committed observation arrives
      |        └── probe may update live
      |
      ├── debugger pauses at safe boundary
      |        └── probe must match paused snapshot
      |
      └── execution ends
               └── probe may become retained if supported
</code></pre>

<h3>11.1 Live view</h3>

<p>
During a running execution, a probe MAY update as new compatible committed observations become available.
The exact refresh cadence is implementation-defined.
</p>

<h3>11.2 Paused view</h3>

<p>
When a debug session is paused, probe-visible information MUST match the paused execution snapshot exposed to the IDE.
A probe MUST NOT show values or state that contradict the paused source-level view.
</p>

<h3>11.3 Retained view</h3>

<p>
A stronger observability profile MAY support retained probe values after execution has completed, faulted, aborted, or otherwise ended.
If retained values are supported, the IDE MUST clearly distinguish them from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>live-updating values,</li>
  <li>paused-snapshot values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>11.4 Instance association</h3>

<p>
When retained behavior is supported, a retained observation SHOULD remain attributable to the execution instance
from which it was derived.
An IDE MUST NOT silently conflate retained observations from unrelated instances.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="edge-probes">12. Edge Probes</h2>

<h3>12.1 Role</h3>

<p>
An <code>edge_probe</code> is attached to one source edge.
It is the canonical probe kind for ordinary dataflow inspection in FROG.
</p>

<h3>12.2 Update trigger</h3>

<p>
An edge probe is updated when the target edge receives a compatible observable
<code>edge_value_available</code> observation in the relevant execution context,
or when an equivalent paused committed observation confirms the current edge value.
</p>

<h3>12.3 Meaning</h3>

<p>
The meaning of an edge probe is:
</p>

<pre><code>show the last-known committed value
that became available on this source edge
in the relevant execution context
</code></pre>

<h3>12.4 Fan-out</h3>

<p>
If one source output fans out to multiple edges, each edge MAY have its own probe.
This is correct because source-level inspection is naturally edge-based even if the runtime internally optimizes fan-out.
</p>

<h3>12.5 Repeated dynamic contexts</h3>

<p>
If the same edge is activated across different iterations or nested scopes,
the probe SHOULD preserve the relevant context.
A stronger profile MAY show iteration metadata or a visible context stack together with the displayed value.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="port-probes">13. Port Probes</h2>

<h3>13.1 Purpose</h3>

<p>
A <code>port_probe</code> is attached to a specific source node port rather than to a full edge.
This is useful when the IDE wants to present inspection at the node boundary level.
</p>

<h3>13.2 Input and output ports</h3>

<p>
A port probe MAY target:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>an input port,</li>
  <li>an output port.</li>
</ul>

<h3>13.3 Preferred use of edge probes</h3>

<p>
When the source graph already provides an explicit edge identity for ordinary valueflow,
an implementation SHOULD prefer edge probes for canonical dataflow inspection.
Port probes are an additional inspection form, not the preferred default for ordinary wire-level understanding.
</p>

<h3>13.4 Meaning</h3>

<p>
A port probe attached to an output port SHOULD be semantically equivalent to probing the emitted committed value
at that source boundary.
A port probe attached to an input port SHOULD reflect the committed value received at that input
in the relevant execution context.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="local-memory-probes">14. Local-Memory Probes</h2>

<h3>14.1 Purpose</h3>

<p>
A <code>local_memory_probe</code> is attached to the local-memory slot owned by a local-memory node instance.
Its purpose is to inspect source-aligned memory behavior rather than only ordinary edge values.
</p>

<h3>14.2 Canonical v0.1 case: <code>frog.core.delay</code></h3>

<p>
For <code>frog.core.delay</code>, a local-memory probe SHOULD make it possible to inspect at least,
when the active observability support exposes the corresponding information:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the most recent observed <code>state_read</code>,</li>
  <li>the most recent observed <code>state_updated</code>,</li>
  <li>the current stored state visible at pause time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>14.3 Meaning</h3>

<p>
A local-memory probe is not merely another edge probe.
It is attached to the stateful source-aligned object owned by the node instance.
It therefore observes local-memory activity without redefining primitive-local behavior or language-level cycle semantics.
</p>

<h3>14.4 Deterministic paused interpretation</h3>

<p>
If a local-memory probe displays a current stored value during a paused snapshot,
that value MUST be the committed stored value for the paused execution instance.
</p>

<pre><code>delay node instance
   ├── observed state_read
   ├── observed state_updated
   └── paused current stored value
        (only when exposed by the active observability support)
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="ui-related-probes">15. UI-Related Probes</h2>

<h3>15.1 Ordinary widget-related valueflow</h3>

<p>
Ordinary widget-related valueflow SHOULD be inspected through the same canonical mechanisms as other dataflow:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>edge probes on edges connected to <code>widget_value</code>,</li>
  <li>port probes on relevant widget-related ports when supported.</li>
</ul>

<h3>15.2 Object-style widget interaction</h3>

<p>
Object-style widget interaction through <code>widget_reference</code>,
<code>frog.ui.property_read</code>, <code>frog.ui.property_write</code>,
and <code>frog.ui.method_invoke</code> MAY be inspected through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordinary valueflow targets when relevant,</li>
  <li>pause-consistent debug inspection,</li>
  <li>stronger-profile UI-specific probe renderers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For ordinary widget value participation in dataflow, tools SHOULD prefer the natural
<code>widget_value</code> representation rather than object-style property access.
</p>

<h3>15.3 UI sequencing edges</h3>

<p>
The <code>ui_in</code> / <code>ui_out</code> sequencing edges are not ordinary data-value edges.
A stronger observability profile MAY support probes on these edges, but such probes MUST be interpreted as
<strong>effect-order inspection</strong> rather than ordinary value inspection.
</p>

<p>
If supported, such probes MUST remain aligned with both:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the source-facing widget interaction model,</li>
  <li>the relevant <code>frog.ui.*</code> primitive definitions.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="presentation-and-management">16. Presentation and Management</h2>

<h3>16.1 Presentation model</h3>

<p>
This document does not standardize one required probe window layout.
It standardizes the source-level meaning of probe displays.
</p>

<h3>16.2 Minimal displayed information</h3>

<p>
A v0.1 probe display SHOULD be able to show at least:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the probe target identity,</li>
  <li>the most recent compatible observation when available,</li>
  <li>basic state information such as live, paused, retained, or unavailable,</li>
  <li>basic execution-context information when relevant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>16.3 Possible presentations</h3>

<p>
An IDE MAY present probes through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>inline overlays near the target,</li>
  <li>detachable probe windows,</li>
  <li>a probe inspector pane,</li>
  <li>another equivalent local-inspection presentation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>16.4 Probe management</h3>

<p>
A probe-capable IDE SHOULD support at least:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>create probe,</li>
  <li>remove probe,</li>
  <li>list active probes,</li>
  <li>locate a probe from its source target,</li>
  <li>locate the source target from its probe entry.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A stronger observability profile MAY additionally support:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>pinning a probe window,</li>
  <li>grouping probes by FROG or by execution instance,</li>
  <li>sorting by creation order,</li>
  <li>showing last-update timestamps,</li>
  <li>bulk removal.</li>
</ul>

<h3>16.5 Probe naming and numbering</h3>

<p>
An IDE MAY assign probe numbers or names for management purposes.
Such naming is an IDE concern only and is not part of the canonical source model.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="validation-and-safety-rules">17. Validation and Safety Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A probe MUST target a valid source-visible object supported by the active observability support.</li>
  <li>A probe MUST NOT alter execution semantics.</li>
  <li>A probe shown during pause MUST reflect the paused execution snapshot exposed to the IDE.</li>
  <li>A retained probe value MUST be clearly distinguishable from a live-updating value and from a paused-snapshot value.</li>

<ul>
  <li>conditional probes that trigger debugger break behavior,</li>

<h2 id="summary">20. Summary</h2>

<p>
FROG probes are <strong>source-attached inspection objects</strong> for live, paused, and optionally retained execution views.
For v0.1, the canonical probe model is centered on ordinary dataflow inspection through source edges,
while also allowing additional probe forms for ports and local memory when supported.
</p>

<p>
This specification establishes that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>probes belong to the IDE inspection layer rather than the source language itself,</li>
  <li>probes consume execution observability but do not own debugger controls,</li>
  <li><code>edge_probe</code> is the minimum and primary probe form for v0.1,</li>
  <li>probe-visible values represent compatible committed observations,</li>
  <li>paused probe views must remain causally consistent,</li>
  <li>retained values are optional and must be clearly identified as such,</li>
  <li>probes remain distinct from centralized watch entries,</li>
  <li>stronger profiles may add richer or more specialized probe forms without changing the base semantics.</li>
</ul>
