<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This directory defines the architectural home of open execution-facing representations in the FROG specification.
</p>

<p>
A FROG program is not authored directly as an execution IR. It is authored as canonical source, admitted through structural validity, interpreted as validated program meaning, and only then represented as a canonical open execution intermediate representation.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of <code>IR/</code> is to ensure that execution-facing representation is not scattered across:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>source-format documents,</li>
  <li>source-schema artifacts,</li>
  <li>IDE-internal authoring models,</li>
  <li>cache payload examples,</li>
  <li>primitive or profile catalogs,</li>
  <li>runtime-private scheduler forms,</li>
  <li>backend-specific realization documents,</li>
  <li>host-private UI realization layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This directory therefore provides the durable normative home for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical Execution IR Document itself,</li>
  <li>the derivation boundary from validated program meaning to canonical open IR,</li>
  <li>the construction boundary for materially building conforming canonical IR documents,</li>
  <li>the identity and mapping boundary that preserves attribution and recoverability,</li>
  <li>the schema posture and machine-checkable validation surface of the canonical JSON IR form,</li>
  <li>the first downstream-adjacent boundaries toward lowering and backend-facing handoff.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>canonical source
      -&gt;
structural validity
      -&gt;
validated program meaning
      -&gt;
canonical Execution IR Document
      -&gt;
later specialization / lowering
      -&gt;
backend-facing handoff
      -&gt;
private realization</code></pre>

<p>
The core of this layer is the canonical open Execution IR bundle. The directory also contains downstream-adjacent documents that define how open IR connects to later stages without collapsing the open IR layer into runtime-private form.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="reading-legend">2. Reading Legend</h2>

<p>
The diagrams in this README use the following visual legend:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open specification-facing layer or document</li>
  <li>Standardized boundary, correspondence, mapping, schema, or handoff</li>
  <li>Lowering or target-specialization zone</li>
  <li>Implementation-private realization zone</li>
  <li>Semantic truth, attribution, recoverability, or diagnostic obligation</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="why-this-layer-exists">3. Why this Layer Exists</h2>

<p>
FROG deliberately separates several architectural levels that are often conflated in graphical systems:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical saved source artifact,</li>
  <li>the source-owned structural admission boundary,</li>
  <li>the IDE editable in-memory model,</li>
  <li>validated program meaning,</li>
  <li>the canonical execution-facing representation used to prepare execution,</li>
  <li>the later forms used to specialize execution for a target.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Without a dedicated IR layer, execution-facing representation tends to drift into:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>editor-side convenience structures,</li>
  <li>cache examples,</li>
  <li>runtime-private scheduler graphs,</li>
  <li>compiler-specific internal pipelines,</li>
  <li>backend-private deployment formats,</li>
  <li>UI-runtime-private object tables treated as if they were language truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The IR layer exists to stop that drift and to give execution-facing representation a stable architectural home.
</p>

<pre><code>Expression/ says:
"what is saved and structurally admitted as source"

IDE/ says:
"what is edited"

Language/ says:
"what the validated program means"

IR/ says:
"what canonical open execution-facing representation is built
from that validated meaning"

Lowering says:
"how canonical open IR is specialized for a target"

Runtime says:
"how one implementation realizes execution internally"</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="architectural-boundary">4. Architectural Boundary</h2>

<p>
The shortest correct mental model of the surrounding architecture is:
</p>

<pre><code>+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Layer             | Primary question answered                        |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Expression/       | What is the canonical saved source?              |
|                   | What counts as structurally valid source?        |
| Language/         | What does the validated program mean?            |
| Libraries/        | What intrinsic primitives exist?                 |
| Profiles/         | What optional standardized capabilities exist?   |
| IDE/              | How is the program authored and observed?        |
| IR/               | What canonical open execution-facing             |
|                   | representation is built from validated meaning?  |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>

<p>
A second boundary view is:
</p>

<pre><code>validated program meaning
          |
          v
canonical open Execution IR
          |
          v
identity / mapping / derivation / construction / schema boundary
          |
          v
lowering / backend preparation
          |
          v
compiler / backend / runtime-private realization</code></pre>

<p>
The key architectural rule is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>IR/</code> begins after validated program meaning,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> defines the canonical open execution IR boundary artifact,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> remains before lowering and backend-facing contract,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> MUST remain distinct from runtime-private realization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
More precisely, the core open-IR bundle is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Execution IR.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Derivation rules.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Construction rules.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Identity and Mapping.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Schema.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>schema/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The downstream IR-adjacent documents are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Lowering.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>Backend contract.md</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This architectural boundary also applies to UI and widget-related execution-facing structure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>IR may preserve execution-relevant widget identities, widget references, member addresses, and event categories where validated meaning requires them,</li>
  <li>IR MUST NOT absorb host-side widget realization, SVG rendering strategy, or runtime-private UI object storage as if those were open IR truth.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="position-in-the-representation-pipeline">5. Position in the Representation Pipeline</h2>

<p>
The intended position of the IR layer is illustrated below:

</div>

<p>
The transition into <code>IR/</code> begins after the program has validated program meaning. An implementation MAY derive IR directly from canonical source, from a validated Program Model, or from another equivalent validated internal form, but the resulting IR MUST remain semantically grounded in validated program meaning rather than in parser-only acceptance, structural-source admission alone, or editor-only convenience state.
</p>

<p>
The practical corridor that the IR layer closes explicitly is:
</p>

<pre><code>.frog source
    |
    v
loadability
    |
    v
structural validity
    |
    v

    |
    v
canonical JSON validation
    |
    v
lowered / backend-facing forms
    |
    v
compiler / runtime-private forms</code></pre>

<p>
This is the practical corridor that the IR layer closes explicitly:
</p>

<pre><code>validated program meaning
        -&gt;
derivation
        -&gt;
recoverable IR identity and mapping
        -&gt;

        -&gt;
canonical Execution IR Document
        -&gt;
canonical JSON schema validation
        -&gt;
later lowering and backend-facing handoff</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="scope-of-this-directory">6. Scope of this Directory</h2>

<p>
This directory owns the architectural answers to questions such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What open execution-facing representations are standardized by FROG?</li>
  <li>What is the architectural boundary between validated program meaning and open IR?</li>
  <li>Which execution-facing properties are preserved from validated program meaning into IR?</li>
  <li>Which properties may be made more explicit in IR without changing semantic truth?</li>
  <li>How is the canonical Execution IR Document derived and constructed from validated program meaning?</li>
  <li>How are identity, attribution, and recoverability preserved between source-visible content and IR content?</li>
  <li>How is the canonical JSON form of the Execution IR validated?</li>
  <li>Where does open IR stop and later specialization begin?</li>
  <li>What downstream handoff assumptions may be standardized without collapsing into runtime-private realization?</li>
  <li>How widget-object interaction surfaces are preserved into open execution-facing form without absorbing host realization?</li>
</ul>

<p>
This directory therefore contains both:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>core open-IR documents that define the open execution-facing layer itself, and</li>
  <li>downstream IR-adjacent documents that define how later stages connect to that layer.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Core open-IR bundle
- Execution IR model
- derivation rules
- construction rules
- recoverable identity and mapping
- schema posture
- machine-checkable schema artifacts

Downstream IR-adjacent documents
- lowering
- backend contract</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="what-this-directory-does-not-own">7. What this Directory Does Not Own</h2>

<p>
This directory does not define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical <code>.frog</code> source structure in full,</li>
  <li>source-schema posture or machine-checkable source shape artifacts,</li>
  <li>the public interface source model in full,</li>
  <li>the front-panel source model in full,</li>
  <li>the complete widget source model in full,</li>
  <li>the complete <code>.wfrog</code> package-family definition in full,</li>
  <li>the normative execution semantics of the language in full,</li>
  <li>the intrinsic primitive catalogs in full,</li>
  <li>the optional standardized profile catalogs in full,</li>
  <li>the IDE Program Model,</li>
  <li>IDE-facing debug UX or observability UX,</li>
  <li>cache ownership,</li>
  <li>runtime-private execution formats,</li>
  <li>runtime-private widget object storage,</li>
  <li>host-side widget realization packages,</li>
  <li>SVG rendering strategy as such,</li>
  <li>one mandatory compiler architecture,</li>
  <li>one mandatory backend-family implementation,</li>
  <li>one mandatory runtime-private storage model.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This non-ownership rule is essential. Without it, the IR layer would become a catch-all replacement for other parts of the architecture.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relation-with-surrounding-layers">8. Relation with Surrounding Layers</h2>

<h3>8.1 Relation with Expression</h3>

<p>
<code>Expression/</code> owns canonical source representation and structural validity. That ownership remains authoritative even when canonical IR exists.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>canonical source identity MUST remain owned by <code>Expression/</code>,</li>
  <li>the existence of an Execution IR document MUST NOT redefine what a valid <code>.frog</code> file is,</li>
  <li>the absence of an embedded or sidecar IR artifact MUST NOT invalidate canonical source,</li>
  <li>IR attribution SHOULD remain able to refer back to source-visible objects defined by <code>Expression/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>.frog source
   is not
Execution IR

Execution IR
   is derived from
validated program meaning

structural validity
   is not
Execution IR</code></pre>

<p>
The same rule applies to related widget-oriented source packages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>.wfrog</code> packages remain source-side package artifacts owned by the relevant Expression-side architecture,</li>
  <li>IR may preserve the resolved consequences of validated widget package usage,</li>
  <li>IR does not become the owner of widget package definition or realization-package architecture.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.2 Relation with Language</h3>

<p>
<code>Language/</code> defines what a validated FROG program means when it executes. That semantic layer remains authoritative even when one or more execution IR artifacts exist.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Language/</code> defines semantic truth,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> defines canonical open execution-facing representation,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> MUST NOT silently change language meaning,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> MAY make semantic consequences more explicit where execution preparation requires it.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>Language/ answers:
"What is true?"

IR/ answers:
"What open execution-facing representation is built
from that truth?"</code></pre>

<p>
For widget-object interaction, this means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Language/ owns the validated meaning of widget-value participation and object-style widget interaction,</li>
  <li>IR/ may encode execution-facing consequences of that validated meaning,</li>
  <li>IR/ must not redefine widget law or host realization law.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.3 Relation with Libraries and Profiles</h3>

<p>
<code>Libraries/</code> owns intrinsic primitive vocabularies. <code>Profiles/</code> owns optional standardized capability families. The IR layer does not re-own either catalog.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>primitive identity remains owned by the relevant library layer,</li>
  <li>optional capability identity remains owned by the relevant profile layer,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> derives execution-facing representation from validated use of those surfaces,</li>
  <li><code>IR/</code> may standardize how those validated uses appear in open IR, but not what primitives or profiles exist in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This includes UI primitives such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_read</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_write</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.method_invoke</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
IR may standardize the execution-facing representation of validated uses of those primitives. IR does not own the primitive families themselves.
</p>

<h3>8.4 Relation with the IDE Program Model</h3>

<p>
The IDE Program Model is an authoring-facing internal or semi-internal representation used to support editing, round-trip operations, diagnostics workflows, and related tooling. It is not the same thing as the canonical open Execution IR.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Program Model MAY contain editor-side convenience state,</li>
  <li>the Program Model MAY preserve round-trip authoring detail that the canonical open IR does not own,</li>
  <li>the canonical Execution IR SHOULD NOT depend on editor-only presentation state as if that state were part of validated program meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This also applies to UI authoring state such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>selection state,</li>
  <li>zoom state,</li>
  <li>designer-only handles,</li>
  <li>panel editing overlays,</li>
  <li>temporary widget inspection panels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.5 Relation with Cache Artifacts</h3>

<p>
A FROG source or toolchain MAY embed or associate cache artifacts that store derived execution-facing data such as <code>frog.ir</code>. However, the cache container does not own the architectural definition of IR. It only provides a storage or transport location for derived artifacts.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>cache entries such as <code>frog.ir</code> MAY carry serialized canonical Execution IR data,</li>
  <li>cache presence MUST NOT change canonical source meaning,</li>
  <li>cache metadata MUST NOT affect execution semantics,</li>
  <li>the normative meaning of Execution IR belongs in <code>IR/</code>, not in cache examples.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>IR meaning
   lives in
IR/

serialized derived artifact
   may live in
cache entry: frog.ir

cache container
   is not
IR ownership</code></pre>

<h3>8.6 Relation with Observation, Debugging, and Diagnostics</h3>

<p>
This directory does not own debugger UX, probe presentation, watch presentation, or runtime command surfaces. It does own part of what makes later source-aligned observation and diagnostics possible:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>recoverable identity and mapping,</li>
  <li>attribution and correspondence carriers,</li>
  <li>stable execution-facing categories,</li>
  <li>a canonical open boundary that can be referred to before runtime-private realization begins.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words:
</p>

<pre><code>IDE/
   owns
how users inspect and interact

IR/
   owns part of
what makes source-aligned inspection and attribution possible</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="widget-object-and-ui-corridor">9. Widget Object and UI Corridor</h2>

<p>
FROG v0.1 already distinguishes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>widget instance declaration in canonical source,</li>
  <li>class-level widget law,</li>
  <li>diagram-side widget interaction,</li>
  <li>widget-oriented package definitions,</li>
  <li>runtime interpretation,</li>
  <li>host realization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The IR layer must preserve that separation while still providing an execution-facing corridor for widget-relevant validated meaning.
</p>

<h3>9.1 What IR may preserve</h3>

<p>
IR may preserve execution-relevant widget-related information such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>stable widget identities needed by execution-facing interaction,</li>
  <li>distinction between natural widget value participation and object-style widget reference participation,</li>
  <li>validated widget member addressing consequences,</li>
  <li>event categories and event payload shapes where execution-facing form needs them,</li>
  <li>attribution back to widget instances and addressed members.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.2 What IR must not absorb</h3>

<p>
IR must not absorb:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>widget class package ownership,</li>
  <li>widget realization package ownership,</li>
  <li>SVG asset ownership,</li>
  <li>host-private widget composition strategies,</li>
  <li>runtime-private UI object tables,</li>
  <li>one implementation's rendering pipeline as if it were canonical open IR.</li>
</ul>

<h3>9.3 Practical corridor</h3>

<p>
The practical widget-related IR corridor is therefore:
</p>

<pre><code>widget instance in canonical source
        -&gt;
validated widget participation meaning
        -&gt;
validated widget reference / member access meaning
        -&gt;
execution-facing IR preservation of identities and accesses
        -&gt;
later lowering / target adaptation
        -&gt;
runtime and host realization</code></pre>

<p>
This corridor is especially important for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>widget_value</code>,</li>
  <li><code>widget_reference</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_read</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.property_write</code>,</li>
  <li><code>frog.ui.method_invoke</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Open IR may preserve their validated execution-facing structure. Open IR does not become the owner of widget realization itself.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="internal-document-structure">10. Internal Document Structure</h2>

<p>
The current directory structure is:
</p>

<pre><code>IR/
├── schema/
├── Backend contract.md
├── Construction rules.md
├── Derivation rules.md
├── Execution IR.md
├── Identity and Mapping.md
├── Lowering.md
├── Readme.md
└── Schema.md</code></pre>

<p>
This structure is intentionally split between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the core open-IR bundle, and</li>
  <li>the downstream IR-adjacent bundle.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The core open-IR bundle is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Execution IR.md</code></li>
  <li><code>Derivation rules.md</code></li>
  <li><code>Construction rules.md</code></li>
  <li><code>Identity and Mapping.md</code></li>
  <li><code>Schema.md</code></li>
  <li><code>schema/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
The downstream IR-adjacent bundle is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Lowering.md</code></li>
  <li><code>Backend contract.md</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
A coherent next closure direction for widget-object execution-facing structure would also make room for dedicated IR companion documents such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Widget object mapping.md</code>,</li>
  <li><code>UI interaction lowering.md</code>,</li>
</ul>

<p>
Those documents are not required to understand the present directory posture, but they are a natural extension of the corridor defined here.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="document-ownership-split">11. Document Ownership Split</h2>

<p>
The ownership split inside <code>IR/</code> is:
</p>

<pre><code>Execution IR.md
   - canonical open execution-facing architecture

Derivation rules.md
   - normative derivation from validated meaning to canonical IR

Construction rules.md
   - material construction of conforming canonical IR payloads

Identity and Mapping.md
   - attribution, correspondence, and recoverability law

Schema.md
   - schema posture for canonical JSON IR

schema/
   - machine-checkable schema artifacts

Lowering.md
   - downstream specialization boundary

Backend contract.md
   - standardized consumer-facing handoff after lowering</code></pre>

<p>
This split matters because it prevents one giant document from blurring architectural responsibility.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="ownership-quick-check">12. Ownership Quick Check</h2>

A fast ownership check is:

When the concrete question is specifically about widget-object execution-facing preservation, a useful reading sequence is:

<h2 id="status-in-v01">14. Status in v0.1</h2>

<p>
In the current published v0.1 posture, the IR layer is no longer only architectural prose. It already defines a real corridor:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>validated program meaning,</li>
  <li>canonical Execution IR derivation,</li>
  <li>recoverable identity and mapping,</li>
  <li>material canonical IR construction,</li>
  <li>canonical JSON schema validation,</li>
  <li>later lowering and backend-facing handoff.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This means the repository is already beyond a purely aspirational architecture-only stage. It already exposes the documents needed to reason about a serious compiler-oriented handoff, while keeping LLVM or any other compiler family strictly downstream from the language-owned IR layer.
</p>

<p>
The active closure direction in v0.1 is therefore not to invent a new IR concept, but to keep tightening:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>conformance alignment,</li>
  <li>identity and recoverability law,</li>
  <li>derivation correctness,</li>
  <li>schema posture,</li>
  <li>lowering and backend-contract discipline,</li>
  <li>the execution-facing preservation corridor for widget-object interaction without collapsing into host realization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">15. Summary</h2>

<p>
<code>IR/</code> is the architectural home of canonical open execution-facing representation in FROG.
</p>

<p>
It begins after validated program meaning and remains upstream from lowering, backend-facing contract, and runtime-private realization.
</p>

<p>
Its core role is to ensure that execution-facing structure becomes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>open,</li>
  <li>inspectable,</li>
  <li>attributable,</li>
  <li>recoverable,</li>
  <li>schema-checkable in canonical JSON form,</li>
  <li>ready for disciplined downstream specialization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The internal split of the directory is intentional:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the core open-IR bundle defines the canonical execution-facing layer itself,</li>
  <li>the downstream IR-adjacent documents define how later stages connect to that layer without replacing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That same discipline now applies explicitly to widget-related execution-facing structure:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>validated widget interaction meaning may be preserved in open IR,</li>
  <li>but widget package ownership, host realization, SVG rendering logic, and runtime-private UI object structures remain outside the ownership boundary of <code>IR/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
That is the architectural purpose of <code>IR/</code> in FROG v0.1.
