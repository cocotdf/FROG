<h2 id="overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
This document defines the backend contract for FROG v0.1.
</p>

<p>
The backend contract is the first standardized consumer-facing handoff after lowering.
It defines what a later compiler stage, backend stage, execution-preparation stage, deployment-preparation stage, or runtime intake stage may rely on when consuming a lowered FROG execution form.
</p>

<p>
It exists to keep the following layers distinct:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the canonical Execution IR Document, which remains open, inspectable, and source-attributable,</li>
  <li>the specialization space of lowering,</li>
  <li>the standardized consumer-facing handoff,</li>
  <li>the private realization that follows.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>validated program meaning
        |
        v
canonical Execution IR Document
        |
        v
lowering
        |
        v
backend contract
        |
        v
private realization</code></pre>

<p>
The backend contract is therefore:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>not the canonical Execution IR Document itself,</li>
  <li>not the whole lowering space,</li>
  <li>not one private runtime representation,</li>
  <li>not one vendor ABI,</li>
  <li>not one mandatory executable artifact format.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="boundary-contract">2. Boundary Contract</h2>

<p>
The backend contract is the standardized declaration by which a lowered execution form says:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what executable content is being offered for consumption,</li>
  <li>which backend-facing assumptions are already fixed,</li>
  <li>which capabilities are required,</li>
  <li>which execution-relevant distinctions remain explicit or encoded,</li>
  <li>which source-aligned attribution obligations still apply,</li>
  <li>which later-stage freedoms remain available to the consumer,</li>
  <li>which situations must be rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is therefore a consumption contract, not merely a lowered graph dump.
In practical terms, the contract says:
</p>

<pre><code>"You may consume this lowered form
under these assumptions,
with these preserved meanings,
and with these remaining obligations."</code></pre>

<p>
A backend contract is not necessarily identical to the lowered artifact itself.
A backend contract may be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>embedded in a lowered artifact,</li>
  <li>stored alongside it,</li>
  <li>represented through a dedicated contract payload,</li>
  <li>represented through another equivalent explicit mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What matters is not one transport syntax.
What matters is the presence of a standardized, explicit consumer-facing handoff downstream from the canonical open IR boundary.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="position-in-the-pipeline">3. Position in the Pipeline</h2>

<p>
The intended architecture is:
</p>

<pre><code>canonical source (.frog)
        |
        v
validated program meaning
        |
        v
canonical Execution IR Document
  - open
  - inspectable
  - source-attributable
  - schema-checkable in canonical JSON form
  - not backend-private
        |
        v
Lowering
  - specialization begins
        |
        v
Backend Contract
  - standardized consumable handoff
        |
        v
compiler / backend / deployment / runtime realization</code></pre>

<p>
The key interpretation rule is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Execution IR remains the canonical open execution-facing representation.</li>
  <li>Lowering is where specialization begins.</li>
  <li>Backend Contract is where consumer assumptions become explicit.</li>
  <li>Private realization remains downstream and is not standardized here.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The backend contract therefore sits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>after lowering has begun,</li>
  <li>after the canonical open IR boundary has already been established,</li>
  <li>before private realization takes over.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="scope">4. Scope</h2>

<p>
This document defines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what a backend contract is in FROG,</li>
  <li>what information a lowered producer MUST provide to later stages,</li>
  <li>what a backend consumer MAY assume,</li>
  <li>what a backend consumer MUST preserve or reject,</li>
  <li>what remains attributable across the handoff,</li>
  <li>which architectural categories MUST remain explicit at the contract boundary.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document owns the standardized consumable handoff boundary.
</p>

<p>
It does not own:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the full lowering transformation space,</li>
  <li>the full private runtime realization,</li>
  <li>the full observability protocol,</li>
  <li>the full debugger protocol,</li>
  <li>the full deployment artifact model.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="non-goals">5. Non-Goals</h2>

<p>
This document does not define:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>one mandatory serialized artifact format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory ABI,</li>
  <li>one mandatory scheduler representation,</li>
  <li>one mandatory bytecode format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory JIT interface,</li>
  <li>one mandatory deployment package format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory debugging protocol,</li>
  <li>one mandatory runtime-private state object model,</li>
  <li>one mandatory runtime-module layout,</li>
  <li>one mandatory LLVM-only contract shape.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It also does not redefine:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>canonical source,</li>
  <li>validated program meaning,</li>
  <li>the canonical open Execution IR Document,</li>
  <li>the full lowering transformation space.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This document standardizes the handoff boundary, not the entire world downstream from it.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="core-definition">6. Core Definition</h2>

<p>
A backend contract is the explicit standardized statement that a lowered FROG execution form is now ready for downstream consumption under declared assumptions.
</p>

<p>
A backend contract therefore defines:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the lowered executable scope being handed off,</li>
  <li>the backend family or families the handoff targets,</li>
  <li>the target-facing assumptions already fixed,</li>
  <li>the categories that remain semantically significant at the handoff,</li>
  <li>the producer commitments that the consumer may rely on,</li>
  <li>the consumer obligations that still apply,</li>
  <li>the rejection conditions if assumptions are violated.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Compactly:
</p>

<pre><code>backend contract
   =
standardized handoff
for
consuming lowered executable meaning
without guessing what lowering already fixed</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="contract-parties">7. Contract Parties</h2>

<p>
The contract has two architectural parties:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Producer</strong> — the stage that emits the lowered execution form and the associated backend contract,</li>
  <li><strong>Consumer</strong> — the later stage that consumes the contract in order to produce machine code, bytecode, deployment artifacts, runtime intake structures, or another downstream realization artifact.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These parties are architectural roles.
They are not tied to one vendor, one executable, or one repository layout.
</p>

<p>
A producer MAY be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a compiler front-stage,</li>
  <li>a lowering pipeline,</li>
  <li>a profile-specific specialization stage,</li>
  <li>a deployment-preparation stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A consumer MAY be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a native backend,</li>
  <li>an LLVM-oriented compiler stage,</li>
  <li>a VM-oriented consumer,</li>
  <li>a runtime loader,</li>
  <li>a deployment packager,</li>
  <li>a hybrid execution-preparation stage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The producer/consumer distinction matters because the contract exists precisely to prevent hidden assumptions between them.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="backend-family-target-profile-deployment-mode-and-runtime-boundary">8. Backend Family, Target Profile, Deployment Mode, and Runtime Boundary</h2>

<p>
These four concepts MUST remain distinct:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Backend family</strong> — the family of downstream consumer architecture, such as native-code-oriented, VM-oriented, interpreter-oriented, accelerator-oriented, or other backend families.</li>
  <li><strong>Target profile</strong> — the FROG profile-level capability surface and target-facing expectations recognized by the specification stack.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment mode</strong> — how the produced artifact is intended to be packaged, delivered, started, embedded, or hosted.</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime boundary</strong> — the point where private realization begins and standardized handoff ends.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are related but not interchangeable.
</p>

<pre><code>backend family
   != target profile

backend family
   != deployment mode

deployment mode
   != runtime-private realization

runtime boundary
   != canonical IR boundary</code></pre>

<p>
A backend contract MAY mention all four.
It MUST NOT collapse them into one ambiguous target label.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="contract-identity-and-backend-family">9. Contract Identity and Backend Family</h2>

<p>
A backend contract SHOULD carry explicit identity sufficient to answer:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>which lowered executable scope it describes,</li>
  <li>which producer emitted it,</li>
  <li>which backend family it targets,</li>
  <li>which versioned contract semantics apply,</li>
  <li>which canonical or lowered artifact it is associated with.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This does not require one mandatory identifier syntax.
It does require that a consumer not be forced to guess which contract semantics apply.
</p>

<p>
A backend-family declaration MUST be explicit enough to prevent ambiguity such as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>native LLVM-oriented consumer versus interpreter consumer,</li>
  <li>CPU-native consumer versus accelerator-oriented consumer,</li>
  <li>backend family versus deployment mode confusion.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="contract-boundary">10. Contract Boundary</h2>

<p>
The backend contract is the first place where lowered producer assumptions become explicit for downstream consumption.
</p>

<p>
It is therefore the boundary where the producer says:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what is already fixed,</li>
  <li>what remains flexible,</li>
  <li>what category distinctions remain semantically relevant,</li>
  <li>what the consumer must preserve,</li>
  <li>what the consumer must reject if it cannot honor the contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The backend contract MUST NOT be read as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the definition of FROG semantics,</li>
  <li>a replacement for the canonical open IR,</li>
  <li>a license to reinterpret invalid upstream material,</li>
  <li>a hidden runtime-private implementation dump.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The contract boundary is therefore:
</p>

<pre><code>explicit
consumer-facing
specialization boundary</code></pre>

<p>
and not:
</p>

<pre><code>the point where truth becomes private by default</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="minimum-preconditions">11. Minimum Preconditions</h2>

<p>
A conforming backend contract in base v0.1 requires, at minimum:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a semantically accepted program,</li>
  <li>a canonical Execution IR Document that was valid for the accepted subset,</li>
  <li>a lowered form that remained semantically faithful,</li>
  <li>preserved attribution and recoverability up to the contract boundary where still required,</li>
  <li>explicit declaration of backend-facing assumptions relevant to the consumer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A backend contract MUST NOT be emitted from:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>raw source alone,</li>
  <li>merely loadable source,</li>
  <li>merely structurally valid source,</li>
  <li>an IR that already lost required category distinctions before lowering finished,</li>
  <li>a silently repaired invalid construct.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>no validated meaning
   -&gt; no conforming backend contract

no canonical open IR
   -&gt; no conforming backend contract

no semantically faithful lowering
   -&gt; no conforming backend contract</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="required-contract-content">12. Required Contract Content</h2>

<p>
A backend contract MUST expose enough information for a consumer to decide whether it can consume the lowered form without guessing.
</p>

<p>
In base v0.1, that required content SHOULD include, as applicable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>contract identity,</li>
  <li>producer identity or equivalent producer declaration,</li>
  <li>contract version or contract semantics version,</li>
  <li>backend family declaration,</li>
  <li>lowered executable scope,</li>
  <li>capability requirements,</li>
  <li>type or representation commitments already fixed,</li>
  <li>storage or memory commitments already fixed,</li>
  <li>effect / call / service boundary commitments already fixed,</li>
  <li>control and state semantics that remain relevant to the consumer,</li>
  <li>required preserved category distinctions,</li>
  <li>mapping or attribution anchors still required for diagnostics or recoverability,</li>
  <li>rejection conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This does not force one serialized syntax.
It does force one explicit consumer-facing content surface.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="producer-obligations">13. Producer Obligations</h2>

<p>
A producer emitting a backend contract MUST:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>emit the contract only after semantically faithful lowering,</li>
  <li>state backend-facing assumptions explicitly,</li>
  <li>state the consumer-relevant preserved distinctions explicitly or equivalently,</li>
  <li>state required capabilities explicitly,</li>
  <li>state rejection conditions explicitly,</li>
  <li>preserve enough mapping continuity for diagnostics and downstream fault attribution where still required,</li>
  <li>avoid presenting backend-private convenience as though it were canonical language truth.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A producer MUST NOT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>hide unresolved semantic ambiguity behind a contract,</li>
  <li>silently repair invalid upstream content,</li>
  <li>erase required distinctions and hope the consumer can reconstruct them privately,</li>
  <li>emit a contract that leaves consumer obligations guess-based.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="consumer-obligations">14. Consumer Obligations</h2>

<p>
A consumer receiving a backend contract MAY assume only what the contract makes explicit or what the referenced specification layers already define.
</p>

<p>
A consumer MUST:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>respect the declared backend family and capability assumptions,</li>
  <li>respect preserved category distinctions that remain semantically relevant at the contract boundary,</li>
  <li>reject the contract if it cannot honor a required assumption,</li>
  <li>avoid silently reinterpreting ambiguous or unsupported contract content,</li>
  <li>avoid back-projecting its own private realization choices as though they were required by FROG itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A consumer MUST NOT:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>treat unspecified freedoms as guaranteed freedoms,</li>
  <li>treat omitted semantics as permission to invent new semantics,</li>
  <li>erase required attribution or diagnostics anchors if the contract still requires them,</li>
  <li>reinterpret public-interface, state, structure, UI, or effect categories in ways that contradict the contract.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="preservation-invariants">15. Preservation Invariants</h2>

<p>
The backend contract is downstream from lowering, but it is not a truth-erasure boundary by default.
</p>

<p>
At the contract boundary, the following invariants MUST still hold where applicable:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>semantic faithfulness,</li>
  <li>explicit state remains explicit state,</li>
  <li>required control and boundary semantics remain preserved,</li>
  <li>required UI-related category distinctions remain preserved,</li>
  <li>required attribution and recoverability remain preserved to the extent still declared at the contract boundary,</li>
  <li>consumer assumptions are explicit, not inferred from private conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Compactly:
</p>

<pre><code>backend contract
   may narrow consumer freedoms

backend contract
   must not erase required truth silently</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2 id="control-state-and-boundaries">16. Control, State, and Boundaries</h2>

<p>
At the backend contract boundary, the producer MUST preserve enough information so that the consumer does not have to guess critical execution categories.
</p>

<p>
This includes, where relevant:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>structured control obligations,</li>
  <li>state participation obligations,</li>
  <li>initialization obligations,</li>
  <li>effect boundaries,</li>
  <li>public boundary participation,</li>
  <li>structure-boundary participation,</li>
  <li>explicit sequencing obligations that remain relevant downstream.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The contract MUST NOT collapse:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ordinary connectivity and explicit state participation,</li>
  <li>ordinary connectivity and explicit sequencing,</li>
  <li>public boundary participation and structure-boundary participation,</li>
  <li>explicit state semantics and scheduler-private persistence tricks.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A consumer must never be forced to infer these categories only from opaque lowered shapes if the contract still depends on them.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="ui-participation">17. UI Participation</h2>

<p>
UI-related participation remains especially sensitive at the contract boundary.
</p>

<p>
Where UI-related categories remain relevant to the consumer, the contract MUST preserve the distinction between:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>public interface participation,</li>
  <li><code>widget_value</code> participation,</li>
  <li><code>widget_reference</code> participation,</li>
  <li>standardized UI-object primitive operations,</li>
  <li>explicit UI sequencing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A contract MAY present these through:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>explicit category fields,</li>
  <li>service-boundary declarations,</li>
  <li>call-surface declarations,</li>
  <li>other equivalent explicit means.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It MUST NOT collapse them into one vague “UI interaction” bucket if later consumption still depends on the distinction.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="diagnostics-observability-and-fault-attribution">18. Diagnostics, Observability, and Fault Attribution</h2>

<p>
The backend contract SHOULD preserve enough mapping continuity so that later failures remain attributable.
</p>

<p>
This does not require a full debugger protocol here.
It does require that downstream consumers are not forced to diagnose failures on completely anonymous artifacts when the contract can still preserve meaningful anchors.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, where relevant, the contract SHOULD support:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>diagnostic mapping to lowered units or partitions,</li>
  <li>fault attribution to preserved state, control, UI, or call categories,</li>
  <li>traceability toward upstream canonical IR or validated contributors where still required,</li>
  <li>distinction between contract rejection and downstream realization failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This discipline is especially important for an industrial compiler corridor, because backend failures must not become uninterpretable merely because the contract boundary was underspecified.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="relation-with-libraries-profiles-conformance-and-compiler-families">19. Relation with Libraries, Profiles, Conformance, and Compiler Families</h2>

<p>
The backend contract is downstream from Libraries, Profiles, and the canonical IR stack, but it must still remain compatible with them.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Libraries/</code> still own intrinsic primitive identity and primitive-local meaning,</li>
  <li><code>Profiles/</code> still own optional capability surfaces and target-facing capability families,</li>
  <li><code>Conformance/</code> still owns the public accept / reject / preserve truth surface,</li>
  <li>compiler families such as LLVM-oriented native backends remain downstream consumers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The backend contract therefore does not replace these layers.
It carries their downstream-consumable consequences after lowering.
</p>

<p>
This matters especially for compiler families:
</p>

<pre><code>FROG
   -&gt;
validated meaning
   -&gt;
canonical Execution IR
   -&gt;
lowering
   -&gt;
backend contract
   -&gt;
LLVM-oriented or other backend-family consumer</code></pre>

<p>
The contract may support an LLVM-oriented route.
LLVM still does not become the definition of FROG.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="minimal-conceptual-shape">20. Minimal Conceptual Shape</h2>

<p>
A minimal conceptual backend contract may be thought of as carrying categories such as:
</p>

<pre><code>backend contract
├── contract identity
├── version / semantics version
├── producer declaration
├── backend family declaration
├── executable scope declaration
├── capability requirements
├── lowered representation commitments
├── control / state / effect commitments
├── preserved category distinctions
├── mapping / attribution anchors where required
└── rejection conditions</code></pre>

<p>
This is illustrative only.
It does not impose one serialized payload syntax.
It makes explicit the minimal conceptual surface a consumer should not have to guess.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="contract-lifecycle">21. Contract Lifecycle</h2>

<p>
A backend contract typically passes through the following lifecycle:
</p>

<pre><code>canonical IR exists
   -&gt;
lowering fixes backend-relevant assumptions
   -&gt;
producer emits backend contract
   -&gt;
consumer validates compatibility
   -&gt;
consumer accepts or rejects
   -&gt;
accepted contract drives downstream realization</code></pre>

<p>
This lifecycle matters because rejection is a first-class outcome.
A contract is not useful if unsupported assumptions are silently ignored.
</p>

<p>
A conforming consumer SHOULD reject explicitly when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>required capabilities are unsupported,</li>
  <li>backend family is mismatched,</li>
  <li>preserved category requirements cannot be honored,</li>
  <li>contract version semantics are unsupported,</li>
  <li>required control, state, or effect commitments are incompatible with the consumer.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2 id="out-of-scope-for-v01">22. Out of Scope for v0.1</h2>

<p>
The following are out of scope for this document in base v0.1:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>one mandatory binary contract format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory ABI surface,</li>
  <li>one mandatory LLVM contract shape,</li>
  <li>one mandatory runtime-loader protocol,</li>
  <li>one mandatory deployment-package specification,</li>
  <li>one mandatory debug-info transport format,</li>
  <li>one mandatory scheduler artifact model,</li>
  <li>one mandatory cross-process or cross-device transport scheme.</li>
</ul>

<p>
These may be specified later through additional documents, profiles, implementation workspaces, or backend-family-specific material.
They do not weaken the current handoff-boundary obligations.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="summary">23. Summary</h2>

<p>
This document defines the backend contract for FROG v0.1 as the first standardized consumer-facing handoff after lowering.
</p>

<p>
Its core rules are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the backend contract is downstream from canonical open IR and lowering,</li>
  <li>it makes consumer assumptions explicit,</li>
  <li>it defines what the consumer may rely on,</li>
  <li>it preserves required semantic distinctions and obligations at the handoff boundary,</li>
  <li>it does not replace language truth, canonical IR, or private runtime realization,</li>
  <li>it enables serious downstream compiler or runtime families without collapsing FROG into one of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A serious industrial compilation corridor therefore has the following discipline:
</p>

<pre><code>.frog
   -&gt;
validated meaning
   -&gt;
canonical FROG Execution IR
   -&gt;
lowering
   -&gt;
backend contract
   -&gt;
LLVM-oriented or other downstream consumer
   -&gt;
private realization</code></pre>

<p>
The backend contract is the explicit handoff that makes this downstream corridor robust.
It allows specialization to become consumable without letting private compiler or runtime assumptions replace the open language-owned truth surface upstream.
</p>
